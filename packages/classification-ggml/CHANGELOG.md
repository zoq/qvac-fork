## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-05

This release adds Google FuzzTest coverage for the image preprocessor and wires
bounded fuzz runs into the Linux C++ CI workflow. No public addon API changes.

## Features

### FuzzTest coverage for `preprocessToTensor`

The addon now ships Phase 0 fuzzing for `ImagePreprocessor::preprocessToTensor`,
exercising both the encoded-image decode path (JPEG/PNG magic detection and
`stb_image` decode) and the raw-RGB resize/normalize path. Fuzz targets compile
the preprocessor sources directly without linking `@qvac/fabric`, so they run
under full ASan + LeakSanitizer.

New npm scripts support local fuzz workflows: `fuzz` (bounded run),
`fuzz:continuous` (coverage-guided, time-boxed via `--fuzz_for`), and
`test:cpp:fuzz` (combined unit-test + fuzz configure/build/run). Production
builds pass `-D BUILD_FUZZING=OFF` explicitly so a prior fuzz configure cannot
skip the shipped `.bare` module.

Fuzz dependencies (Abseil, FuzzTest, RE2, ANTLR4, GoogleTest) resolve from
vcpkg via a new manifest `fuzz` feature. Linux CI runs a bounded fuzz stage
after C++ unit tests in `cpp-tests-classification.yml`.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-07-30

### Changed

- `@qvac/fabric` dependency bumped `^0.3.0` -> `^0.3.1`, picking up
  `qvac-fabric` 9840.1.1 compatibility. No API change for this package.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- `@qvac/fabric` dependency bumped `^0.2.0` → `^0.3.0`, which carries `qvac-fabric`
  `9840.0.0` → `9840.0.1` (training weight-repack disable, Metal `acc`/`set`
  threadgroup dispatch fix, and MoE/hybrid training loss scaling). This package
  consumes the shared runtime via npm rather than building the vcpkg port, so the
  range bump is what picks up the new fabric. No API change for this package.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-23

This release migrates the addon off its bundled, statically-linked `qvac-fabric` vcpkg build and onto the shared `@qvac/fabric` npm runtime. ggml is now loaded once per process from the single `@qvac/fabric` install instead of being duplicated inside every fabric consumer.

### Changed

- The ggml runtime and its compute backends are now provided by the `@qvac/fabric` npm dependency (`^0.2.0`) rather than the static `qvac-fabric` vcpkg port. The addon no longer bundles ggml; on desktop it resolves the single `@qvac/fabric` install and loads the backend modules from `node_modules/@qvac/fabric/prebuilds/<host>/qvac__fabric/`, falling back to this addon's own `prebuilds/` on mobile (where the package tree isn't resolvable from the packed worklet bundle). Run `npm install` so `@qvac/fabric` is present before `bare-make generate`/`build`, and ensure the dependency isn't pruned at runtime.
- The ggml CPU backend is now acquired via the registry API (`ggml_backend_dev_by_type` + `ggml_backend_dev_init`) on every platform, replacing the direct `ggml_backend_cpu_init` call. `@qvac/fabric` does not export `ggml_backend_cpu_init` from its Windows DLL import library, so the previous approach failed to link `win32-x64` prebuilds; `GGML_BACKEND_DL` dlopen is retained only for loading the Linux/Android backend modules.

### Pull Requests

- [#3301](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3301) - QVAC-22035 feat: migrate classification-ggml to shared @qvac/fabric runtime

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- The C++ → JS logger callback invoked the sink method detached from its instance (`const write = sink[level]; write(message)`). Logger implementations that rely on `this` internally (such as `@qvac/logging`'s `QvacLogger`) threw on every call, and the surrounding `try {} catch {}` silently dropped each native log line. The callback now invokes `sink[level](message)` as a method (same bug class fixed in ocr-ggml and translation-nmtcpp under QVAC-22177).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.6` → `9840.0.0` (llama.cpp b9840 rebase; no API change for this package).

### Pull Requests

- [#3036](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3036) - QVAC-22385 rebase qvac-fabric to b9840 (9840.0.0)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Migrated the JavaScript wrapper to TypeScript-authored sources while continuing to publish generated JavaScript entrypoints and declarations. This keeps the runtime package shape stable for SDK and Bare consumers while making wrapper implementation and typings share one source of truth.
- Added TypeScript linting, type checking, and generated-output freshness checks for the wrapper. Publish workflows now rebuild the generated JavaScript and declarations before package publication.
- Tightened the package export boundary so the internal `addon.js` bridge and native `binding.js` loader remain packaged for relative imports but are no longer exported package subpaths. Consumers should continue to use the package root API.
- Added a small Bare example that classifies the existing `meal_1.jpg` test image.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.5` → `9341.1.6` (clip flash-attention AUTO fallback on non-coopmat GPUs + bounded ggml-opencl driver submissions — fixes Android vision-encoder crashes on very large encodes; no API change for this package).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.3` (JsLogger teardown / re-`setLogger` crash fix, QVAC-21544, tetherto/qvac#2932).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.3` → `9341.1.4` (Qwen3-VL grid selection rewrite + CPU CLIP vision-encoder weight repacking for i8mm/AVX2 GEMM; no API change for this package).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-06

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Windows prebuilds now link the static Visual C++ runtime (`/MT`) instead of
  importing `vcruntime140.dll`, `msvcp140.dll`, or UCRT DLLs from the MSVC
  redistributable. Shared monorepo `vcpkg-overlays/triplets/{x64,arm64}-windows.cmake`
  build dependencies with a static CRT; addon CMake no longer links `msvcrt.lib`,
  which had forced the dynamic runtime. Per-package vcpkg overlays were
  consolidated into the shared `vcpkg-overlays/` tree. No public API change.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- Updated the `qvac-fabric` vcpkg dependency to registry version `8828.0.1` for mobile and desktop C++ builds.
- Switched environment access in the JS wrapper to `bare-env`, keeping default model path and native logger toggles compatible with Bare runtimes.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release of the GGML image classification addon.
- `ImageClassifier` public API (`load`, `classify`, `unload`) orchestrated
  via `@qvac/infer-base`'s `createJobHandler` + `exclusiveRunQueue`,
  mirroring the lifecycle pattern used by `@qvac/llm-llamacpp`.
- C++ `ClassificationModel` implementing the MobileNetV3-Small architecture
  directly against `libggml` (34 conv + 2 linear layers, with depthwise
  separable convolutions, HardSwish activations, and squeeze-and-excite
  blocks). BatchNorm is folded into the preceding convolution at load time
  via `foldBn()` (`eps = 0.001`); the runtime graph evaluates only the
  resulting scale/shift, with no per-inference BN op.
- FP16 GGUF weights (2.94 MB) bundled in `weights/` and loaded with
  `gguf_init_from_file()` + `ggml_backend_tensor_set()`.
- Image preprocessing pipeline: JPEG / PNG decode via `stb_image`, bilinear
  resize to 224x224, ImageNet-normalization, WHCN tensor layout.
- Integration tests (brittle + bare) covering happy path, raw-RGB input,
  edge cases, and lifecycle errors.
- C++ unit tests (GoogleTest) covering graph construction, BN epsilon,
  softmax normalization, and FP16 weight loading.
- ONNX-to-GGUF conversion guide in `docs/onnx-to-gguf-conversion.md`.
- `nativeLogger` constructor option (default `false`) that gates the shared
  native C++→JS logger bridge; off by default because the underlying
  `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` `JsLogger` singleton's static `uv_async_t`
  lifecycle is not safe across rapid create/destroy cycles. JS-level
  logging always routes through the caller's `logger`.

### Removed

- `threads` constructor option. libggml's CPU thread pool now sizes itself
  to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency` on every platform. The knob was
  unimplementable on Android (the `ggml_backend_cpu_set_n_threads` symbol
  lives inside the per-microarch CPU variant `.so` loaded via `dlopen`,
  not in the addon's statically-linked `.bare`), and exposing it only on
  desktop / iOS would have produced silently inconsistent behaviour across
  platforms. Removed for API consistency.

> **Note.** SDK plugin / schema integration (canonical model type
> `ggml-classification` with `classification` alias) is **out of scope** for
> 0.1.0 and will land in a follow-up PR; see the PR description for the
> rationale.
