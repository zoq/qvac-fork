/**
 * Helper for detecting the llama.cpp addon's `Cancelled` status error
 * (`LlmErrors.hpp::Cancelled = 27`) on the continuous-batching path.
 *
 * When a batch is cancelled while it still has prompts queued behind the
 * `parallel` slot limit, `ContinuousBatchScheduler::cancelPendingLocked`
 * fails the whole batch group with a `Cancelled` `StatusError`, which
 * `processBatch` rethrows — so `model.run(prompts)` rejects rather than
 * resolving with partial outputs (see
 * `packages/llm-llamacpp/docs/continuous-batching.md` "Cancellation
 * semantics"). In-flight slots are still cancelled gracefully, but the
 * shared group carries the error.
 *
 * The addon's JS-facing throw goes through `js_throw_error(env, code,
 * msg)` (see `JsUtils.hpp::JSCATCH`) where `code` comes from
 * `qvac_errors::StatusError::codeString()` and formats as
 * `"[ <addonId> :: Cancelled ]"`. This helper lets the batch handler
 * recognise that rejection so it can complete the run with cancelled
 * terminal events (matching the graceful cancel semantics) instead
 * of surfacing a generic `CompletionFailedError`.
