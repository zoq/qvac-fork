/**
 * Pure decision helper for kv-cache history slicing used by
 * `completion-stream.ts` (via the slice computed from
 * `TurnHandle.savedCount`).
 *
 * This module intentionally has **no** `bare-*` imports so it can be
 * exercised directly from unit tests running under `bun` without
 * pulling in the Bare runtime (which is not available in that
 * environment).
 *
 * Cancel detection flows through the per-request `AbortSignal` from
 * `RequestRegistry`; the `cachedMessageCounts` map lives in
 * `kv-cache-session.ts`, which owns all three KV-cache bookkeeping
 * layers (saved counts, init flags, on-disk files). Only the pure
 * slice-decision helper remains here.
