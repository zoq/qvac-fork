/**
 * RAG operation tracking — workspace-level admission bookkeeping.
 *
 * In 0.11.0 the cancel surface for in-flight RAG operations consolidates
 * onto the request registry (`getRequestRegistry().cancel({ requestId })`).
 * The historical workspace-level pre-emption rule — "starting a new
 * `ingest` / `reindex` / `saveEmbeddings` on a workspace cancels any prior
 * op on the same workspace" — is preserved by the dispatcher in
 * `server/rpc/handlers/rag.ts`: the dispatcher cancels the workspace's
 * prior `requestId` (if any) and then begins a new registry context.
 * Workspace-level admission lives in the dispatcher rather than as a
 * registry policy primitive — it's a dispatch concern, not part of the
 * registry's per-`kind` admission rules.
 *
 * This module owns the small workspace → requestId map that makes that
 * pre-emption decision routable from the dispatcher. The map is module-
 * scoped (one per Bare process) so the dispatcher, the shutdown sweep
 * (`cancelAllRagOperations`), and the workspace-close sweep (which
 * delegates to it via `rag-workspace-manager.ts`) all see the same state.
