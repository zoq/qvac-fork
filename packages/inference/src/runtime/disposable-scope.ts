 * runtime doesn't expose it (older Bare/Expo build, missing polyfill),
 * the `[Symbol.asyncDispose]:` property key in this file's `dispose`
 * function would coerce to the string `"undefined"` and silently produce
 * objects that look async-disposable but are not — handlers would leak
 * registry entries forever. Better to fail loudly at import time with a
 * clear error than to debug a slow registry leak in production.

/**
 * Bounded-lifetime cleanup scope for an in-flight request.
 *
 * Callers register cleanup callbacks via `defer(...)` while a handler runs.
 * On `[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` (used implicitly by `await using` or
 * explicitly) every registered callback is awaited in **LIFO** order — the
 * mirror of how `try/finally` blocks would unwind in a sequential write-up
 * of the same handler.
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *
 *  - **Idempotent.** A scope can be disposed once. Subsequent disposes are
 *    no-ops; subsequent `defer` calls run the cleanup eagerly so callers
 *    never silently leak a deferred resource if they hand a deferred
 *    callback to an already-disposed scope.
 *  - **Error aggregation.** Every deferred cleanup runs even when an
 *    earlier one throws. If a single cleanup throws, that error is
 *    rethrown verbatim. If two or more throw, an `AggregateError` is
 *    rethrown carrying every failure in the order it occurred. The
 *    handler unwinding the scope can therefore see _all_ cleanup
 *    failures, not just the first one.
