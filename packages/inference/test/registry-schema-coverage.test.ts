// `dispatch` validates every request against `requestSchema` before running a
// handler, so a registered request type with no matching schema is rejected at
// runtime. This asserts the wiring statically: every key in the registry must
// be an accepted `type` in the request-schema union. Adding an operation to the
// registry without its schema fails here rather than silently skipping
// validation + defaulting.
//
// Detection is by parse behavior, not schema introspection, so it holds
// regardless of how a member schema is built (plain object, union, refinement).
// For an unknown type every union branch errors on the `type` field; for a
// known type at least one branch accepts the literal and errors only elsewhere.
