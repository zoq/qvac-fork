# Changelog

## [0.39.4] - 2026-08-04

Internal refactor of how JS configuration is parsed into C++. Generation,
finetune, and load config now use a shared, declarative handler-registry pattern
(the same approach diffusion-cpp uses). No change to accepted config keys,
spellings, or defaults, apart from the edge cases below.

### Changed

- Sending both the hyphen and underscore spelling of `image-max-tokens` or
  `image-min-tokens` in the same load config is now accepted (the underscore
  spelling wins) instead of failing the load. Previously the second spelling was
  forwarded to llama.cpp and rejected.
- In rare multi-error cases, the specific `InvalidArgument` message that surfaces
  first may differ from before: a generation request that sets conflicting
  `grammar`/`json_schema` alongside another invalid field, or a finetune request
  that omits a required field and also sends a malformed optional. Accept/reject
  behavior is unchanged in these cases.

### Pull Requests

- [#3491](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3491) - chore[api]: adopt
  handler-registry pattern for config parsing

## [0.39.3] - 2026-08-04

This release makes DeepSeek V4 cache recovery safe when requests are cancelled
or generation ends before a reasoning block closes. It also adds a supported
string-based `no_mmap` configuration and makes thinking-block compaction
default-on only for the Qwen3 reasoning family.

### Fixed

- DeepSeek V4 text inference now uses full-state checkpoints for request
  cancellation, optional thinking-block compaction, and interrupted terminal
  stops. When `remove_thinking_from_context` is enabled, it restores the
  checkpoint instead of attempting unsafe compressed-cache edits.
- Multimodal continuous-batch drivers now honor the per-request
  `remove_thinking_from_context` override and keep their compactor state in
  sync.
- `no_mmap: 'true'` now disables memory-mapped model loading by setting the
  native model parameter directly, rather than forwarding an unsupported
  command-line argument.

### Changed

- Thinking-block compaction now defaults to `false` for non-Qwen models.
  Qwen3, Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6, and their MoE variants retain the default-on
  behavior; callers can override the setting for any model per request.

### Pull Requests

- [#3634](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3634) - fix: recover DeepSeek
  V4 checkpoints

## [0.39.2] - 2026-07-30

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9840.0.1` -> `9840.1.1`, picking up the
  Vulkan strided `CONCAT` addressing fix with no API change for this package.
- Qwen3.5-VL cache-stress coverage now creates deterministic cache pressure
  with measured, bounded prefill chunks while preserving normal EOS behavior.

## [0.39.1] - 2026-07-29

Extends LoRA finetuning to the b9840 model families: Qwen3.5/3.6 and Gemma-4, dense and
mixture-of-experts. These architectures were previously rejected outright — `finetune()` threw
`Finetuning is not supported for architecture: <arch>`. MoE models additionally need their expert FFN
tensors targeted, so four expert LoRA target modules are now accepted. Complements the fabric-side
training fixes already pinned via `qvac-fabric` 9840.0.1.

### Added

- Qwen3.5/3.6 dense (`qwen35`), Qwen3.x MoE (`qwen35moe`) and Gemma-4 (`gemma4`) are now supported
  finetuning architectures — the allowlist grows from `gemma3`, `qwen3`, `bitnet` to six entries.
- Four MoE expert LoRA target modules accepted in `loraModules`: `ffn_gate_exps`, `ffn_up_exps`,
  `ffn_down_exps`, `ffn_gate_up_exps`. Required to train MoE experts at all — targeting only the dense
  FFN names leaves expert weights untouched.
- Integration coverage: `finetuning-archs` finetunes Qwen3.5-0.8B (desktop + mobile) and Gemma-4-E2B
  (desktop), plus a pause/resume cycle on the new dense architecture; `finetuning-moe` covers
  Qwen3.6-35B-A3B and Gemma-4-26B-A4B, opt-in behind `QVAC_RUN_MOE_FINETUNE=true` because those models
  are ~20–27 GB. C++ unit tests lock backend selection for the new architectures and the expert-target
  bit mapping.
- `QVAC_QWEN35_MTMD_SIZE` (`0.8b` | `2b`) selects the model size for the Qwen3.5 multimodal
  cache-stress test.

### Changed

- `docs/finetuning.md` model-format requirements now list the real architecture allowlist and document
  the MoE expert LoRA targets.

### Pull Requests

- [#3509](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3509) - b9840 finetuning (Qwen3.5/3.6 + Gemma-4, dense + MoE)

## [0.39.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9840.0.0` → `9840.0.1`. This fixes MoE/GDN LoRA
  finetuning: weight repacking is disabled for training loads (backward ops cannot
  read repacked layouts), the Metal `acc`/`set` threadgroup dispatch now covers rows
  wider than one threadgroup, and training on MoE / hybrid / recurrent architectures
  seeds the backward pass from a down-scaled loss so gradients stay within fp32
  range (persisted with the optimizer state). No API change for this package.

## [0.38.2] - 2026-07-23

Adds **Unlimited-OCR**, a DeepSeek-OCR-derived 3B OCR vision-language model, as a supported OCR model alongside LightON OCR-2. Full-page document parsing with `<|det|>` layout regions and HTML table reconstruction — useful for invoices, forms, and scanned reports.

### Added

- Unlimited-OCR ([baidu/Unlimited-OCR](https://huggingface.co/baidu/Unlimited-OCR)) OCR VLM support: registry entry, README + NOTICE, a mobile integration test (`runOcrUnlimitedTest`) that parses a scanned CT-scan report, and a perf test (`runUnlimitedOcrPerfTest`) that records encode/prefill/decode timings, both registered in the android/ios weekly groups. GGUFs (`Q4_K_M` + `F16` mmproj) are pulled from the pinned community conversion [`vimalnakrani/unlimited-ocr-gguf`](https://huggingface.co/vimalnakrani/unlimited-ocr-gguf), the same public-repo pattern used by LightON OCR-2. Prompt-sensitive — use `document parsing.`. Requires `qvac-fabric >= 9840` (`deepseek2-ocr` engine + `deepseekocr` clip projector).

## [0.38.1] - 2026-07-22

This patch release guarantees that a content token follows the EOS-inside-reasoning recovery, so the forced `</think>` substitution can no longer be immediately followed by another end-of-generation token and produce an empty answer. It also exposes the generation stop reason as a new runtime stat.

### Fixed

- When a Qwen3-family model emits EOS while still inside the reasoning channel, the recovery that substitutes the `</think>` close marker now bans end-of-generation tokens on the immediately following sample. On marginal prompts the next token could previously be EOG again, defeating the recovery with an empty answer; the ban is applied unconditionally for that one sample (the generation loop only reaches it while the `n_predict` budget allows the token).

### Added

- `stopReason` runtime stat reports why the most recent single-prompt generation stopped (`none`, `eos`, `antiprompt`, `predictionLimit`, `sequenceLimit`, or `contextOverflow`).

### Pull Requests

- [#3389](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3389) - guarantee a content token after EOS-inside-reasoning recovery

## [0.38.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.6` → `9840.0.0` (llama.cpp b9840 rebase; no API change for this package).

### Pull Requests

- [#3036](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3036) - QVAC-22385 rebase qvac-fabric to b9840 (9840.0.0)

## [0.37.1] - 2026-07-18

This patch release hardens reasoning-cache rollback when generation is truncated before a reasoning span closes. It covers both explicit `n_predict` limits and continuous-batching per-sequence slot limits, preserving the last known-good cache state instead of attempting unsafe reasoning compaction.

### Fixed

- Qwen3.5 text and multimodal requests now roll back the current request when `n_predict` is reached inside an open reasoning span, avoiding recurrent compaction failures when no close marker was captured.
- Continuous batching now propagates scheduler-imposed per-sequence slot truncation as `SequenceLimit`, allowing the driver to use the same rollback path as prediction-limit truncation.
- Batch stop-reason precedence now preserves `Eos` > `PredictionLimit` > `Antiprompt`, so `n_predict` truncation still triggers rollback when a stop string would also match on the same token.
- Added focused C++ regression coverage for MTMD `n_predict` rollback, scheduler `LimitReached` propagation, Qwen3.5 continuous-batching sequence-limit rollback, and sibling request survival.

### Pull Requests

- [#3318](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3318) - QVAC-22472 fix: handle Qwen3.5 n_predict cutoff inside reasoning

## [0.37.0] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.4` (JsLogger concurrent-env ownership hardening fix, QVAC-21544 follow-up).

## [0.36.3] - 2026-07-09

This patch release makes continuous-batch runtime stats wait for backend work to complete before reporting throughput. It also hardens cancellation and reset cleanup around asynchronous llama decode work so KV and recurrent state are not mutated while queued GPU work is still in flight.

### Fixed

- Continuous-batch `tokensPerSecond`, `ppTPS`, and TTFT timing now include the explicit `llama_synchronize()` boundary after `llama_decode()` and multimodal media evaluation, preventing GPU backends from reporting launch-time-only throughput.
- Text and multimodal cancellation paths now synchronize before rolling back prefill or generation state when cancellation bypasses the usual sampler-side synchronization.
- Reset and deferred teardown paths now synchronize before clearing llama memory, including decode/media error paths that can run while a deferred scheduler clear is pending.

### Changed

- Batch and cancellation regression tests were hardened to assert scheduler-owned timing invariants and prefill cancellation rollback without relying on fragile cross-run wall-clock comparisons.

### Pull Requests

- [#3159](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3159) - fix: synchronize async llama decode completion


## [0.36.2] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Android multimodal-projector (mmproj / vision encoder) auto-default narrowed: with `mmproj-use-gpu` unset the projector now defaults to the GPU **only** on positively-detected Adreno 800+ GPUs. All other Android GPU classes — Arm Mali, Adreno < 800, and any GPU whose Adreno tier can't be detected — default to CPU (the LLM layers still run on the GPU). Only Adreno 800+ was benchmarked (QVAC-21257) to encode the projector faster on the mobile GPU than on CPU, so defaulting to GPU on unbenchmarked/undetectable classes was optimistic. Desktop and iOS continue to default to GPU, and an explicit `mmproj-use-gpu` value still overrides the default in either direction.

### Pull Requests

- [#3168](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3168) - fix: default Android mmproj projector to GPU only on Adreno 800+

## [0.36.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Continuous-batch KV-cache saves now match the single-prompt stale backing-store behavior: when a batch slot loaded a persisted cache and that backing file, empty file, or parent directory is externally removed before terminal save, the scheduler drops the stale backing-store state instead of failing the batch.
- Batch cache save failures for unsaved or invalid cache paths remain observable as `UnableToSaveSessionFile`, including missing-parent save paths and cache paths replaced by directories.
- Added focused C++ regression coverage for batch cache round-trips, deleted persisted backing directories, deleted persisted cache files, zero-byte persisted cache files, unsaved missing-parent paths, and directory replacement errors.

### Pull Requests

- [#3157](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3157) - QVAC-21944 fix: preserve batch KV cache save failures for stale paths

## [0.36.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- `mmproj-use-gpu` config key: run the multimodal projector (mmproj / vision encoder) on the GPU (`'true'`/`'on'`/`'1'`) or CPU (`'false'`/`'off'`/`'0'`, case-insensitive). Only honoured when a GPU backend is selected — ignored with a warning on the CPU/GPU-fallback backend. When unset the projector backend is auto-selected per device class (see below).
- Per-device-class auto-default for the projector backend on Android: Mali GPUs and Adreno < 800 default to CPU (projector encode measured slower on the Mali GPU than CPU, and sub-800 Adreno tiers are not yet benchmarked), while Adreno 800+ and other non-Mali Android GPUs default to GPU. Desktop and iOS continue to default to GPU. `BackendSelection` now surfaces Mali detection alongside the Adreno version.

## [0.35.3] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.5` → `9341.1.6` (QVAC-21914: clip flash-attention AUTO fallback on non-coopmat GPUs restores the budget-aware heuristic for huge vision encodes, and ggml-opencl submissions are now bounded — periodic work-budget `clFlush` + flash-attention q-row chunking. Fixes the Pixel 9 Pro (Mali) lmkd OOM and Galaxy S25 Ultra (Adreno 830) driver abort on monolithic 16k-patch tile-mode-disabled encodes; GPU output quality Δ0 and encode/decode within noise on the device farm; no API change for this package).

## [0.35.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- KV-cache stale backing-store handling now only discards active cache state for caches that were actually persisted before. Unsaved RAM-only cache paths with missing parents, cache paths replaced by directories, or other save-path failures continue to surface `UnableToSaveSessionFile` through the existing throw-and-invalidate path.

### Pull Requests

- [#3121](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/3121) - QVAC-21302 fix: preserve KV cache save failures after stale-cache handling

## [0.35.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.3` (JsLogger teardown / re-`setLogger` crash fix, QVAC-21544, tetherto/qvac#2932).

## [0.35.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.4` → `9341.1.5` (Mali/Vulkan GPU projector optimizations — vendor-aware flash-attention gate, Valhall warptile tuning, layernorm fusion, GPU mmproj-encode ~1.46× → ~1.28× of same-device CPU on Pixel 9 Pro — plus OpenCL bidirectional-encoder attention and Adreno vision-encoder fixes; no API change for this package).

## [0.34.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- `test/mobile/integration.auto.cjs` was stale since `qwen3-5-image-tile-mode-tokens.test.js` was added (#2887, 2026-06-29) — the generated dispatch file was never regenerated, so `runQwen35ImageTileModeTokensTest` silently never ran on Android or iOS despite being listed in `test-groups.json`. Regenerated via `npm run test:mobile:generate`; desktop CI was unaffected (it regenerates its own runner list fresh every run).

## [0.34.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.3` → `9341.1.4` (Qwen3-VL grid selection rewrite + CPU CLIP vision-encoder weight repacking into the i8mm/AVX2 buffer, ~1807ms → ~1114ms CPU vision-encode on Pixel 9 Pro; no API change for this package).


## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-07

This release extends reasoning-block KV compaction to hybrid and recurrent SSM models such as Qwen3.5. It also makes reasoning compaction the default behavior for reasoning-capable models, with stricter failure handling so callers do not accidentally continue from cache state that still contains internal thinking traces.

### New APIs

- `generationParams.remove_thinking_from_context` now defaults to `true`. Callers that intentionally want later turns to attend to previous reasoning can still pass `false` per request.
- Hybrid and recurrent SSM models are now supported when their reasoning close marker tokenizes to a single vocab token. The addon snapshots the sequence state at the end of prefill, restores it after generation, and replays the generated opener seed, canonical close marker, and visible answer tail so KV and recurrent state stay coherent.

### Fixed

- Reasoning compaction failures now surface as `StatusError` instead of silently preserving reasoning in cache. The affected sequence is rolled back or cleared before the error escapes, and batch cache saves are skipped on unsafe cancel or compaction-failure paths to preserve the last known-good on-disk cache.
- Qwen3.5 multimodal cache metadata is verified against restored llama memory before a cache file is accepted, preventing stale or partial cache files from desynchronizing `nPast`, physical KV-cell counts, and live memory.
- Context sliding during generation now invalidates tracked reasoning spans and recurrent boundary snapshots, so compaction hard-fails instead of using stale coordinates after the cache window shifts.

### Changed

- The reasoning compaction implementation was split into shared helpers for span tracking, context shifting, recurrent snapshots, rollback state, and snapshot policy. Text and multimodal generation now use the same compaction contract across single-prompt and continuous-batch paths.
- Cache persistence for per-slot batch saves now writes through a temporary file and atomically promotes it into place, matching the single-prompt `CacheManager` behavior.
- Runtime stats preserve user-visible prompt and generation counters across recurrent replay, so maintenance decode work does not inflate throughput or time-to-first-token measurements.

### Pull Requests

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.1.0` → `9341.1.3` (Gemma-4 E2B vision-encoder Arm Mali/Vulkan attention speedup + encoder token-count fix; no API change for this package).

### Pull Requests

## [0.31.2] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- KV-cache auto-default: when the caller does not set `cache-type-k`/`cache-type-v`, both now default to `q8_0` on Metal and Vulkan GPUs (with flash attention on) — quality-neutral vs `f16` and ~47% smaller KV cache. CPU and OpenCL (Adreno) keep the `f16` default (ARM CPU `q8_0` has a measured quality/throughput cost; quantized KV-cache shifts abort on Adreno). Skipped for finetuning, when flash attention is off, and on Adreno+Vulkan. An explicit user cache type is always respected on CPU/Vulkan/Metal.
- Mixed/asymmetric K≠V warning: when `cache-type-k` and `cache-type-v` differ and at least one side is quantized, the addon logs a warning (asymmetric quantized K/V falls off the fused flash-attention path — a notable GPU decode penalty for no quality benefit) but proceeds.
- Adreno 800+ Vulkan guard: quantized KV with flash attention on an Adreno Vulkan backend is rejected with a clean `StatusError` instead of a native abort (defensive — Adreno selects OpenCL by default).

### Changed

- OpenCL (Adreno) KV-cache rejection now carries an actionable message: only `f32`/`f16`/`bf16` are accepted, and any quantized type (`q8_0`, `q4_0`, …) throws a `StatusError` explaining that a quantized K or V cache aborts in `llama_kv_cache::update` on KV-cache shifts (ggml-opencl has no `F32→quantized` requantize kernel; CI-confirmed for both `q8_0` and `q4_0`).
- The KV-cache guards read flash-attention state from both the `flash-attn` and `flash_attn` config keys, so the underscore variant arms the auto-default and the Adreno guard.
- README documents the KV-cache type policy (`cache-type-k`/`cache-type-v` rows + the auto-default, OpenCL allowlist, and mixed-K/V warning).

### Pull Requests

## [0.31.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.2` (self-pin fix for safe `Worklet.terminate()` on Android).

## [0.31.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Multimodal (vision) model support in continuous batching: vision models now enter the batch scheduler via a new `DriverFactory` pattern that decouples the scheduler from concrete context types. Admits multiple prompts containing images and text.
- `PrefillPlan` for sequencing media evaluation: prefill stream now carries text tokens plus `MediaBarrier` entries. The scheduler pauses slots at barriers and evaluates media between batch steps, allowing other slots to progress while vision processing is underway.
- `SequenceDriver` abstraction: `MtmdLlmContext` and `TextLlmContext` now both implement a common interface, enabling the scheduler to work with any driver type without hardcoded multimodal checks.

### Fixed

- Isolated media-evaluation failures to the offending slot's request group, preventing cascade cancellations when vision processing fails mid-batch.
- Improved KV-cell accounting for media slots in overlapping batch admissions.
- Fixed Windows path serialization in JSON by using `generic_string()` instead of `string()` (forward slashes instead of backslashes).

### Changed

- `BatchPrompt.prompt` now accepts any `Message` type (previously text-only), enabling multimodal batches.
- `ContinuousBatchScheduler` no longer imports or references concrete context types; driver selection fully delegated to the model layer.
- Consolidated sequence KV cleanup into a single `clearSeqKv()` helper, eliminating six inline copies across slot-teardown paths.

## [0.30.2] - 2026-06-29

This patch release fixes `image_max_tokens` and `image_min_tokens` being silently dropped when loading a model via the SDK config string map, making the tiling speedup invisible to SDK users.

### Fixed

- `LlamaModel::commonParamsParse` now reads `image_max_tokens` and `image_min_tokens` from the config string map into `common_params`, following the same pattern as `image_tile_mode`. Without this fix, SDK users setting `image_max_tokens: 4096` had the value silently dropped and the 2048 Qwen-VL cap still applied regardless of tile mode.

## [0.30.1] - 2026-06-25

This patch release hardens Qwen3.5-VL cache accounting for multi-turn multimodal chats. It keeps runtime cache-token statistics aligned with llama memory while covering cancellation, cache reload, context sliding, and image-heavy cache pressure paths.

### Fixed

- Qwen3.5-VL multimodal cache tracking now uses physical llama memory token counts for image-heavy prompts, so chat apps can rely on `CacheTokens` even when image KV cells exceed the logical position span.
- Cancelled multimodal prefills now preserve reloadable cache metadata for hybrid/recurrent memory by syncing the saved position with llama memory when token rollback is not available.
- Added focused C++ and JS coverage for Qwen3.5-VL memory token counts, cache-key generation, cached multi-turn multimodal recovery, context sliding, and physical image cache overflow.

- [#2808](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/2808) - fix: harden Qwen3.5 multimodal KV cache handling

## [0.30.0] - 2026-06-24

Adds Qwen3.5-VL multi-tile batching via the `--image-tile-mode` config key, backed by `qvac-fabric` 9341.1.0.

### New APIs

- `image-tile-mode` / `image_tile_mode` config key: `0`/`batched`, `1`/`sequential` (default), `2`/`disabled`. Controls how multi-tile Qwen3.5-VL images are encoded.
- OOM fallback: if batched encoding fails, encoder retries in sequential mode.

### Changed

- `qvac-fabric` dependency bumped `9341.0.0` → `9341.1.0`.

## Pull Requests

- [#2836](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/2836) - QVAC-19119 feat[api]: bump qvac-fabric to 9341.1.0 (llm-llamacpp)

## [0.29.3] - 2026-06-24

This release fixes per-image token budgets for multimodal (vision) contexts, which were previously parsed but never forwarded to the vision encoder, and adds a sensible default cap for Qwen-VL encoders to bound encode cost on high-resolution images.

### Fixed

- `image_min_tokens` / `image_max_tokens` are now forwarded into the vision encoder. They were parsed into `common_params` but never copied into `mtmd_context_params`, so a caller-set cap had no effect and the encoder always used the model-metadata default (up to ~4M pixels → thousands of patches). For dynamic-resolution encoders (Qwen-VL, Pixtral, LFM2, …) callers can now bound the `O(n_patches^2)` encode cost; for fixed-grid encoders it is a no-op.

### Changed

- When no explicit cap is set, Qwen-VL encoders now default to `image_max_tokens = 2048`. Qwen-VL allows up to 4096 image tokens — far more than the ~1024 it needs for grounding — so an uncapped high-resolution image pays `O(n_patches^2)` attention for tokens the model cannot use (and can destabilize generation). The default stays well above the grounding floor while roughly halving worst-case encode + image prefill, and is fully overridable via `image_max_tokens`.
- The default is gated on the mmproj projector type (read from `clip.projector_type`, falling back to `clip.vision.projector_type` for combined vision+audio mmprojs such as Qwen Omni), so smaller-budget dynamic encoders (LightOnOCR / Pixtral at 1024, LFM2 at 256) are never raised above their native limit and fixed-grid encoders (SigLIP / SmolVLM) are unaffected.
- The default cap respects an explicit `image_min_tokens` floor: since mtmd throws when `max_pixels < min_pixels`, the default max is not injected when the caller-set min meets or exceeds it, leaving the budget to the caller / model default.

## [0.29.2] - 2026-06-23

This release adds opt-in KV-cache compaction of completed reasoning blocks, so callers can keep multi-turn context tight on models that emit a `<think>`-style channel. Detection is now driven by the active chat template's thinking tags, falling back to the hardcoded model-family table when the template does not expose them.

### New APIs

- `generationParams.remove_thinking_from_context` (boolean, default `false`). Opting in drops the model's reasoning block from the live KV cache at end of generation. Supported on text and multimodal contexts for models with a recognised reasoning channel. Throws `InvalidArgument` on models with recurrent memory (SSM / hybrid SSM such as Qwen3.5), where the post-shift hidden state would be contaminated.
- `RuntimeStats.thinkingBlockDiscards`: integer count of reasoning blocks compacted out of the KV cache during the request. Aggregated across slots on the continuous-batching path.

### Changed

- Reasoning-channel detection and compaction now prefer the chat template's `thinking_start_tag` / `thinking_end_tag`, with the hardcoded Qwen3 / Gemma 4 tag table kept only as a fallback when the template does not expose tags. This keeps detection aligned with the active template and removes the need to add a new architecture entry for every reasoning model.
- The forced-open span uses the exact template-emitted suffix when `thinking_forced_open` is set, replacing the previous hardcoded `<tag>\n` assumption.
- The Qwen3-specific EOS-inside-reasoning recovery (close-marker substitution + trailing newlines) is now explicitly scoped to the Qwen3 reasoning family. Other families with a recognised channel keep detection / span tracking / compaction but do not inherit the Qwen3 recovery.

### Changed

- Windows prebuilds now link the static Visual C++ runtime (`/MT`) instead of
  importing `vcruntime140.dll`, `msvcp140.dll`, or UCRT DLLs from the MSVC
  redistributable. Shared monorepo `vcpkg-overlays/triplets/{x64,arm64}-windows.cmake`
  build dependencies with a static CRT; addon CMake no longer links `msvcrt.lib`,
  which had forced the dynamic runtime. Per-package vcpkg overlays were
  consolidated into the shared `vcpkg-overlays/` tree. No public API change.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-22

This release makes reasoning-token budgets configurable per model load and per request, while improving how chat-template thinking markers are detected and streamed. It also tightens GPU backend validation so unsupported quantized KV-cache combinations fail early with clear errors instead of reaching backend-specific runtime failures.

### Breaking Changes

- TurboQuant and PolarQuant KV-cache types are now rejected during model configuration on OpenCL and Metal backends, where the required kernels are not available. Use CPU/Vulkan for TBQ/PQ KV-cache modes, or use standard KV-cache types such as `q4_0` and `q8_0` on OpenCL or Metal.

### New APIs

- `reasoning_budget` now accepts positive integer token caps in addition to the existing `-1` unrestricted and `0` disabled modes. Callers can set the cap at model load time or override it per request through generation params.

### Changed

- Reasoning-budget sampling now derives template-specific thinking start/end markers and generation prompts from the active chat template, so capped thinking output stays aligned with models that use custom `<think>`-style delimiters.
- Flash attention now defaults on for supported non-BitNet, non-finetuning configurations, while preserving existing override behavior.

### Fixed

- Metal backend detection now recognizes runtime `mtl*` device names, so CPU-only Apple runs do not get treated as Metal while actual Metal devices still reject unsupported TBQ/PQ KV-cache modes.
- Mobile and desktop LLM integration tests were adjusted for the new backend behavior and to reduce platform-specific flake in reasoning, cache, multimodal, and performance suites.

### Changed

- Updated the `qvac-fabric` vcpkg dependency to registry version `9341.0.0`, which enables `GGML_BACKEND_DL` dynamic backend loading on desktop Linux: the Vulkan GPU backend and runtime-dispatched CPU micro-architecture variants now load as standalone modules from `prebuilds`.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Continuous-batching support: `run()` now accepts an array of prompts and decodes them concurrently in a single native batch. Each request streams independently and resolves in the original submission order. Per-request generation params and explicit ids are supported via `BatchPrompt` wrappers.
- `avgConcurrentSeq` runtime stat reporting the average number of sequences decoded together during a request.

### Fixed

- Token-budget stop (`n_predict`) no longer fires on the single-prompt decode path, where the generation loop already caps output. The guard was consuming an extra eval cycle and breaking C++ unit tests.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-06

This release adds sliding-context support for M-RoPE/iM-RoPE models such as Qwen3.5 and Qwen-VL style decoders. Long-running multimodal sessions can now slide under context pressure while preserving image recall, cache save/load behavior, and quantized KV-cache operation.

### Features

#### M-RoPE/iM-RoPE sliding context

`llm-llamacpp` now tracks multimodal context usage as both logical decoder positions and physical KV-cache cells. This lets Qwen3.5-style prompts slide at the right time even when image chunks occupy a different number of cache cells than position slots.

Context sliding now supports bounded full-wipe and tail-preserving fallback behavior while respecting the configured discard budget. Native KV memory-operation failures surface as `ContextSlideFailed`, making them distinguishable from ordinary context overflow.

Shifted multimodal cache metadata now persists both logical positions and KV-cache usage, so sessions that slide after image turns can be saved and loaded without losing track of protected prefixes or current cache occupancy.

#### Quantized KV-cache sliding coverage

The local `qvac-fabric` overlay now points at the Fabric branch with M-RoPE/iM-RoPE K-shift support and quantized KV-cache shift handling. Integration coverage exercises Qwen3.5 text sliding, tool-compaction pressure, multimodal image recall after sliding save/load, quantized K-cache sliding, and Llama RoPE baseline sliding.

### New APIs

#### `ContextSlideFailed`

`ContextSlideFailed` is a new addon error code used when Fabric/native KV memory operations reject a sliding range. Callers can now tell this apart from context overflow, where there is simply not enough room to append the requested tokens.

### Fixed

- **Multi-GPU params rejected on Android/iOS**: passing `split-mode` (non-`none`), `main-gpu`, or `tensor-split` on a mobile device now throws `InvalidArgument` immediately in `commonParamsParse`, before any backend selection occurs. Previously these parameters could reach the Adreno OpenCL backend and trigger a native `ggml_abort` (SIGABRT) after a full inference suite. Use single-GPU config (`split-mode: "none"` or omit the field) on mobile.

### Changed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.1`.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-06-02

Minor bump: `UnableToSaveSessionFile` is now a new observable throw on paths that previously succeeded silently, which is a new public error surface.

### Fixed

#### KV-cache file writes are now atomic; save failure throws `UnableToSaveSessionFile`

`CacheManager::writeCacheFile` previously discarded `llama_state_save_file`'s return value, silently leaving a partial or missing `.bin` at the canonical cache path on failure. The SDK worked around this with `fsPromises.access` probes, but those cannot detect partial-but-nonzero files.

The write is now atomic: state is saved to `path + ".tmp"` first, then renamed to the canonical path on success. `llama_state_save_file` returning `false`, or a subsequent rename failure, both throw `qvac_errors::StatusError` with the new `UnableToSaveSessionFile` error code (25). The `.tmp` file is removed in both error cases so no partial write can ever reach the canonical path.

`UnableToSaveSessionFile` can now surface from any of the four `saveCache()` call sites:

- **Explicit save** (`LlamaModel.cpp`) — when the caller sets `saveCacheToDisk: true`.
- **Cache switch** (`CacheManager::handleCache`) — when a new `cacheKey` is passed while a different cache is active; the old cache is flushed before loading the new one.
- **Cache clear** (`CacheManager::handleCache`) — when `cacheKey` is empty while a cache is active; the active cache is flushed before the state is cleared.
- **Pre-finetune flush** (`LlamaFinetuner.cpp`) — the active cache is flushed to disk before fine-tuning begins.

In the cache-switch and cache-clear paths, a failed save now calls `resetStateCallback_(true)` and then `invalidate()` before re-throwing. `resetStateCallback_` clears the in-memory KV state immediately so that any retry with a new `cacheKey` starts from a clean context rather than stale KV from the previous session. `invalidate()` clears `sessionPath_` and disables caching so the next prompt does not attempt to flush the failed path again. The explicit-save and pre-finetune paths do not call `invalidate()`:

- **Pre-finetune**: the model is about to be rebuilt by the finetune reload path; `CacheManager` state does not carry over.
- **Explicit save**: inference already completed and the in-memory KV state is valid — only the disk write failed. Leaving `sessionPath_` intact lets the caller retry or continue from the existing in-memory state. Callers that cannot recover should call the manager's `invalidate()` themselves before discarding the model.

#### Cache-file overwrite on Windows is now atomic on NTFS

`std::filesystem::rename` on Windows fails when the destination file already exists, so second-and-later saves to a given `cacheKey` would throw `UnableToSaveSessionFile` even though the write to `.tmp` succeeded. The promotion step now uses `MoveFileExW(tmp, canonical, MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING | MOVEFILE_WRITE_THROUGH)` on Windows, which atomically replaces the destination on NTFS — the old canonical file is preserved intact if promotion fails, eliminating the data-loss window that a delete-then-rename fallback would create.

### Changed

- Updated the `qvac-fabric` vcpkg dependency to registry version `8828.0.2`.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- TurboQuant / PolarQuant KV-cache integration coverage, including mobile test grouping, a benchmark-style quantized KV-cache sanity test, and a focused supported-combination sweep for Vulkan/CPU-capable platforms.
- Cross-platform C++ unit-test model download and runner scripts, with SHA256 verification and CI-mode fixture selection.

### Fixed

- `cancel()` now keeps the native addon alive for the async cancel/pause wait path, avoiding a use-after-free if JS teardown destroys the instance while cancellation is in flight.
- JSON schema and user grammars are now tagged with the expected upstream grammar type wrappers.
- TurboQuant / PolarQuant KV-cache types now fail early with a clear `InvalidArgument` on OpenCL and Metal backends, where the required kernels are not available.

### Changed

- Updated the `qvac-fabric` vcpkg dependency to registry version `8828.0.1`.
- Expanded Qwen3.5 and Gemma 4 integration coverage around GPU/mobile paths.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-05-13

This release is a pure internal C++ refactor of the addon: the LoRA finetuning pipeline now lives in its own `LlamaFinetuner` class instead of inside `LlamaModel`. There are no JS API changes and no behaviour changes — finetune training, pause/resume, and adapter save go through exactly the same code paths.

## Internals (no behaviour change)

### `LlamaFinetuner` split out of `LlamaModel`

`LlamaModel` previously owned both the inference path and the entire LoRA finetune pipeline (training loop, dataset prep, optimizer/scheduler, pause/resume checkpoint state). All of that finetune-only state and ~20 private helpers have been moved into a dedicated `LlamaFinetuner` class. `LlamaModel` exposes it via a `finetuner()` accessor and delegates the in-`process()` finetune dispatch to `finetuner_.finetune(...)`. Lifetime is guaranteed by composition (the finetuner is declared last and destroyed first), so callers don't need to think about ownership.

`FinetuneTerminalResult` and the `ProgressCallback` alias move with the implementation; `FinetuneConfigOverrides` stays on `LlamaModel` because `reload()` / `tuneConfigMap()` on the inference path still consume it. Method bodies, locking, and the `STANDALONE_TEST_BUILD` guards are all preserved verbatim — this is a pure move, intended to make lifetime and locking on the finetune path easier to reason about and to unblock follow-up cleanups (collapsible clear/pause helpers, dropping the `friend class LlamaFinetuner` once the remaining cross-class accesses get small accessors).

### Deprecated `llama_adapter_lora_free` deleter dropped on resume

The resume path previously attached a custom deleter that called `llama_adapter_lora_free`, which is deprecated upstream ("adapters are now freed together with the associated model"). That deleter was the source of the three `-Wdeprecated-declarations` warnings called out in 0.20.0. Adapters in current llama.cpp are tied to the model's lifetime, and the surrounding `reload(FinetuneConfigOverrides{})` calls on both the happy and error paths already destroy and rebuild the model, so the explicit free is unnecessary and the warnings are gone.

### Misc

- `AddonJs.hpp` now goes through `llamaModel->finetuner().{isFinetuneRunning,requestPause,waitUntilFinetuningPauseComplete}()` and uses `LlamaFinetuner::ProgressCallback`.
- `CMakeLists.txt` compiles `LlamaFinetuner.cpp` into both the addon and the `cli_tool` targets.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

#### MedPsy GGUF models now apply their embedded chat template

MedPsy models report `general.architecture = qwen3` in GGUF metadata, so the llm addon was substituting the hardcoded Qwen3 chat templates in `ChatTemplateUtils` whenever the model was loaded. That replaced the model's own embedded Jinja chat template — which contains a `{%- set persona -%}` block injecting the `"You are MedPsy, ..."` system prompt the model is fine-tuned to expect — and as a result the model lost its identity at runtime and answered as a generic assistant.

The addon now identifies MedPsy models via the GGUF `general.basename` metadata (case-insensitive match against `MedPsy`) and:

- `ChatTemplateUtils::getChatTemplateForModel` returns an empty string for MedPsy, so `common_chat_templates_init` falls through to the model's embedded chat template instead of substituting the hardcoded Qwen3 ones. The Qwen3 reasoning state and EOS handling in `TextLlmContext` continue to apply because the architecture is still `qwen3`.
- `LlamaModel::commonParamsParse` auto-enables `params.use_jinja` when it detects the MedPsy basename, so the embedded Jinja template is applied even when the caller did not pass `tools: 'true'`. The auto-enable is gated on `!use_jinja`, so passing `tools: 'true'` continues to work and the auto-enable log is correctly skipped.

After the fix, MedPsy self-identifies correctly at runtime (e.g. `"I'm MedPsy, a medical and healthcare AI assistant developed by QVAC."`).

The new `qvac_lib_inference_addon_llama::utils::isMedPsyBasename` and `isMedPsyModel` helpers are unit-tested for null, empty, exact match, mixed case, and near-miss strings such as `MedPsy-7B` and `NotMedPsy`.


## [0.20.0] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- **`qvac-fabric` >= 8189.0.2**: Mali/Adreno F16 coopmat1 NaN fix, Qwen3.5 OpenCL kernels, Gemma 4 vision/audio support, Vulkan VMA migration, plus accumulated upstream fixes since `7248.x`.
- **OpenCL backends default `flash-attn=off`** (not reliably supported on OpenCL); user `flash-attn`/`flash_attn` overrides are honored.
- **Qwen3 detection is architecture-only** now (`general.architecture == "qwen3"`); the previous `general.name` substring fallback is removed.

### Added

- **`reasoning-budget`** (`-1` unrestricted, default; `0` disabled) config knob, wired through to fabric's `enable_thinking` template input. Underscore variant `reasoning_budget` accepted.
- **Synthetic `<think>\n` opener** at stream start when the chat template force-opens the reasoning channel (Qwen3, Qwen3.5, DeepSeek-R1) so consumers see balanced reasoning markup.
- **Integration tests**: Qwen3.5 (basic, multi-turn, tool calling, image describe, reasoning-budget=0); Gemma 4 E2B via bartowski Q4_K_M (basic, multi-turn, image describe on GPU on mobile, tool calling with native-dialect parser, reasoning-budget=0); PaddleOCR-VL.
- **C++ unit tests**: OpenCL flash-attn auto-disable, Qwen3 tools-at-end double-tokenize, expanded `tuneConfigMap` coverage.

### Removed

- AfriqueGemma + Dolphin-MoE integration tests; MedGemma variants from tool-calling and finetune-pause-resume.
- Dead `selectToolsCompactMarker(std::string)` overload (its only callers were unit tests).

### Fixed

- `utils.js downloadFile` redirect race that could `fs.unlink` a freshly-redirected file via late writestream errors.
- Sliding-context test rebased on the post-`GGML_PAD` effective `n_ctx=512`.
- Logger no longer asks V8 to `JSON.stringify` multi-MB media `Uint8Array` content (was triggering Zone OOMs on long media prompts).

### Deprecated

- `llama_adapter_lora_free` is now deprecated upstream; the LoRA-resume path emits three `-Wdeprecated-declarations` warnings, behaviour unchanged. Ownership refactor is a follow-up.

### Internals (no behaviour change)

- ABI port: `common_init_result` → `common_init_result_ptr`; LoRA adapter API: `llama_clear_adapter_lora` + `llama_set_adapter_lora` → `llama_set_adapters_lora`; parser example: `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_MAIN` → `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_COMMON`.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-05-05

### Added

#### `ppTPS` runtime stat
- `runtimeStats()` now includes `ppTPS` (prompt processing tokens per second), reporting the throughput of the prompt evaluation phase.
- Calculated as `(1000 / t_p_eval_ms) * n_p_eval` using llama.cpp's `llama_perf_context()` data, matching the "prompt eval time" line in llama-cli output.
- Returns `0.0` only when no prompt was actually evaluated (e.g. full cache hit). Prefill-only runs report `ppTPS` normally — the perf context is explicitly flushed before returning so the counter is populated.
- Exposed on `RuntimeStats` in `index.d.ts` alongside the existing `TPS` (generation throughput) field.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

#### GPT-OSS Harmony tool calling: `<|call|>` frame delimiter now surfaces to the SDK

The `<|call|>` token (Harmony frame terminator) is in the model's EOG set. When sampled, it rendered as 0 bytes and silently stopped generation — tool call output was truncated with no visible frame boundary, resulting in the SDK parsing 0 tool calls.

The generation loop now detects Harmony models and intercepts `<|call|>` before the generic EOG break: it renders the token as visible text (`special=true`) so the SDK can identify frame boundaries, then stops generation cleanly. GPT-OSS uses a turn-based tool protocol — one tool call per generation pass — and the SDK is expected to execute the tool, append results, and re-prompt for subsequent calls.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-29

This release adds per-request structured-output support to the LLM addon: callers can now constrain a single completion to either a JSON Schema or a raw GBNF grammar without reloading the model.

### Added

#### Per-request `json_schema` and `grammar` in `generationParams`

`RunOptions.generationParams` accepts two new optional fields:

- **`json_schema`** — JSON Schema applied to a single `run()` call. Accepts either a JSON Schema object literal or a pre-stringified JSON Schema. Internally converted to GBNF via llama.cpp's `json_schema_to_grammar()`, the same converter used by the load-time `--json-schema` config key.
- **`grammar`** — raw GBNF string applied to a single `run()` call. Useful for non-JSON outputs (regex-like DSLs, CSV, custom syntaxes). Mirrors the load-time `--grammar` config key.

The two are mutually exclusive — passing both throws a `TypeError` at the JS boundary.

When either is set, the sampler is re-initialized for that request and the prior (typically load-time) grammar is restored automatically afterwards. This unblocks structured output for SDK consumers without forcing a model reload per request.

```js
// JSON Schema (recommended for structured output)
await model.run(prompt, {
  generationParams: {
    json_schema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: { name: { type: 'string' }, age: { type: 'integer' } },
      required: ['name', 'age']
    }
  }
})

// GBNF (non-JSON outputs)
await model.run(prompt, {
  generationParams: {
    grammar: 'root ::= ("yes" | "no")'
  }
})
```

A new `nlohmann-json` vcpkg dependency is pulled in (header-only) so the addon can call `json_schema_to_grammar()` directly without shipping a JSON-Schema-to-GBNF converter on the JS side.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

#### `saveCacheToDisk` is now honoured on prefill-only runs

When `processPromptImpl` ran with `prompt.prefill === true`, it returned early and skipped the post-inference branch that persists the KV cache. As a result, a prefill warm-up call with `saveCacheToDisk: true` and a valid `cacheKey` would build the cache in memory but never write it to disk, defeating the purpose of priming the cache for a follow-up turn.

The save logic has been extracted into a new static helper `maybeSaveCacheToDisk(...)` that preserves the original guard (`saveCacheToDisk && cacheManager has value && hasActiveCache()`). Both the `prompt.prefill` early-return branch and the post-generation path now go through this helper, so prefill and full inference persist the cache identically.

A subsequent normal turn that reuses the same `cacheKey` will now correctly load the prefilled tokens from disk and only tokenize/process the incremental delta.

#### `main_gpu` underscore variant is now accepted

The `main_gpu` configuration key was silently ignored - only `main-gpu` (hyphen) was recognised by `tryMainGpuFromMap`, even though every other config parameter accepts both hyphen and underscore forms. This inconsistency could cause GPU selection to quietly not apply, leaving inference on an unintended device.

`main_gpu` is now treated as an alias for `main-gpu` in `BackendSelection`, matching the behaviour of `split-mode`/`split_mode` and `tensor-split`/`tensor_split`. Providing both forms simultaneously still throws an error, as with the other dual-form parameters.

### Documentation

#### New multi-GPU inference guide

A new document at `docs/multi-gpu.md` explains how to distribute a model across multiple GPUs using the four interacting parameters: `device`, `split-mode`, `tensor-split`, and `main-gpu`. It covers:

- The three `split-mode` values (`'none'`, `'layer'`, `'row'`) and what pipeline vs tensor parallelism means in practice.
- Backend-specific behaviour for tensor parallelism - only CUDA and SYCL implement true split-buffer tensor parallelism; Vulkan and Metal fall back to layer parallelism even when `'row'` is requested.
- How `tensor-split` proportions are normalised and applied per GPU.
- How `main-gpu` behaves differently between integrated and dedicated GPUs and across split modes.
- Worked examples for common hardware configurations.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

#### Multi-GPU pipeline parallelism via `split-mode` config

- New `split-mode` (`'none'` | `'layer'` | `'row'`) and `tensor-split` config options enable distributing a model across multiple GPUs via pipeline or tensor parallelism.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

#### `tools_at_end` renamed to `tools_compact`

**Breaking**: The `tools_at_end` configuration option has been renamed to `tools_compact`. The old key is no longer recognized.

#### Anchored tool placement for multi-round tool chains

Tools are now anchored after the **last user message** (via a two-pass Jinja2 template that tracks `last_user_idx`) instead of being appended at the very end of the prompt. The tool boundary is set once on the first round and preserved across chain rounds, so tools stay in the KV cache while the model is still calling tools. Trimming now only happens when the chain completes (output contains no `<tool_call>` tag), instead of after every turn.

This eliminates redundant tokenize → eval → trim cycles during multi-round tool chains and matches the model's expected prompt layout more closely.

#### `<think>` blocks stripped from assistant history

The Qwen3 tools-dynamic template no longer re-injects `<think>…</think>` reasoning blocks into assistant history. Prior assistant messages are replayed with the thinking content stripped, which reduces token waste and avoids the model treating stale reasoning as context.

#### `tools_compact` prompt-shape validation tightened

`tools_compact` now validates prompt layout before inference and fails fast with `InvalidArgument` for malformed inputs (for example: required tools omitted, non-contiguous tool block, tools not attached to the last user/tool anchor, or tools not placed at the end).

### Fixed

#### Context sliding with `tools_compact` could corrupt tool boundary tracking

When context sliding (token discard) occurred during generation or prefill with `tools_compact` enabled, the `nPastBeforeTools` boundary could become stale. This caused post-generation trim to remove the wrong tail region and could leave tool tokens in the KV cache across turns.

Sliding is now centralized through `ContextSlider` + `ToolsCompactController`:
- `clampDiscard()` caps discard so sliding never crosses into protected tool tokens
- `onSlide()` keeps `nPastBeforeTools` aligned after each slide
- Fallback full-wipe paths reset controller state to avoid stale boundaries
- Applied consistently in both `TextLlmContext` and `MtmdLlmContext`

#### Output duplication in streaming mode with `tools_compact`

In streaming mode the captured output buffer was being returned as the final result, causing the SDK to see every token twice (once streamed, once in the result). The captured buffer is now used only for internal `<tool_call>` detection.

#### Generation prompt added on system-only prefill

When `nPast=0` and the only message was a system prompt, `add_generation_prompt` was hardcoded to `true`, injecting a stale `<|im_start|>assistant` token into the cache. Now checks the actual last message role.

#### `"tool"` role not treated as turn-ending for generation prompt

Messages with role `"tool"` (tool call results) were not triggering `add_generation_prompt`, causing empty responses on tool chain continuation. Now treated the same as `"user"` for generation prompt purposes.

#### Empty chat message array now fails with `EmptyPrompt`

`tokenizeChat()` now throws `StatusError(EmptyPrompt)` when called with no chat messages, making empty prompt handling explicit and consistent for both text and multimodal contexts.

### Added

- `runtimeDebugStats()` internal method on `LlamaModel` exposing `nPastBeforeTools`, `firstMsgTokens`, and `toolsTrimmed`
- Comprehensive C++ unit tests for Qwen3 tools-dynamic template and cache management with tools_compact
- Regression tests for context sliding with anchored tools: clamped discard, anchor updates after slide, unclamped sliding with long conversations, and sliding during generation

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-14

This release migrates the LLM addon off `BaseInference` inheritance and the `WeightsProvider` download layer onto the composable `createJobHandler` + `exclusiveRunQueue` utilities from `@qvac/infer-base@^0.4.0`. The constructor signature is replaced with a single object whose `files.model` field is an ordered array of absolute paths and `files.projectionModel` is an optional absolute path for multimodal models. This is a breaking change — every caller must update.

## Breaking Changes

### Constructor signature: single object with `files`, no `Loader`

`LlmLlamacpp` now takes a single `{ files, config, logger?, opts? }` object. The old `Loader` + `diskPath` + `modelName` + two-arg `(args, config)` shape is gone — callers pre-resolve absolute paths and supply them as `files.model`.

```js
// BEFORE (≤ 0.15.x)
const FilesystemDL = require('@qvac/dl-filesystem')
const loader = new FilesystemDL({ dirPath: '/models' })
const model = new LlmLlamacpp({
  loader,
  modelName: 'Qwen3-1.7B-Q4_0.gguf',
  diskPath: '/models',
  logger: console,
  opts: { stats: true }
}, { ctx_size: '4096', gpu_layers: '99' })

// AFTER (0.16.0)
const model = new LlmLlamacpp({
  files: {
    model: ['/models/Qwen3-1.7B-Q4_0.gguf']
  },
  config: { ctx_size: '4096', gpu_layers: '99' },
  logger: console,
  opts: { stats: true }
})
```

For sharded models the caller passes the full ordered list — the `<basename>.tensors.txt` companion first, followed by every `<basename>-NNNNN-of-MMMMM.gguf` shard in ascending order. For multimodal models, `files.projectionModel` carries the absolute path to the mmproj file:

```js
const model = new LlmLlamacpp({
  files: {
    model: [
      '/models/medgemma-4b-it-Q4_1.tensors.txt',

})
```

### `BaseInference` inheritance and `WeightsProvider` removed

`LlmLlamacpp` no longer extends `BaseInference` and no longer touches the `WeightsProvider` download layer. The class composes `createJobHandler` and `exclusiveRunQueue` from `@qvac/infer-base@^0.4.0` directly. Public lifecycle methods (`load` / `run` / `finetune` / `pause` / `cancel` / `unload` / `getState`) are unchanged in shape, but `downloadWeights` and the loader-based progress callbacks are gone — the caller is responsible for placing files on disk before constructing the model.

In-memory streaming from network sources (URLs, Hyperdrive) is no longer supported in the current API. The SDK does not currently use it (models are stored to disk first); this can be re-added when/if the SDK plans to support that feature. Before, it was possible through the `Loader` abstraction.

### Dependency changes

- `@qvac/infer-base` bumped from `^0.3.0` to `^0.4.0`.
- `bare-fs` is now a runtime dependency (used to stream shards from disk).
- `@qvac/dl-base` and `@qvac/dl-filesystem` are no longer used by this package and have been removed from `devDependencies`.

### `getState()` returns a narrower shape

`getState()` previously returned `{ configLoaded, weightsLoaded, destroyed }` (the three-field shape inherited from `BaseInference`). It now returns `{ configLoaded }` only. The `weightsLoaded` and `destroyed` fields are gone — `weightsLoaded` collapsed into `configLoaded` because the refactored `load()` does both in one step, and `destroyed` is no longer tracked since `unload()` resets `configLoaded` and nulls the addon handle instead. Callers reading `state.weightsLoaded` or `state.destroyed` must switch to `state.configLoaded`.

### Public methods removed from `LlmLlamacpp`

`LlmLlamacpp` previously exposed these methods via `BaseInference` inheritance, all of which are now gone:

- `downloadWeights(onDownloadProgress, opts)` — the download layer is removed; the caller places files on disk and passes absolute paths in `files.model` / `files.projectionModel`.
- `unpause()` / `stop()` — BaseInference job-lifecycle helpers. The refactor still exposes `pause()` and `cancel()`; `unpause` is superseded by issuing a new `run()` after `cancel()`.
- `status()` — replaced by `getState()` for the static readiness flag; per-job state is observed via the `QvacResponse` returned by `run()`.
- `destroy()` — folded into `unload()`, which now both releases native resources and nulls `this.addon`.
- `getApiDefinition()` — no longer exposed; consumers should import types from `index.d.ts`.

### `load()` takes no arguments

`load()` previously forwarded `...args` through `BaseInference.load` into LLM's `_load(closeLoader, onDownloadProgress)`. Both arguments are gone — `closeLoader` is meaningless without a `Loader`, and `onDownloadProgress` is superseded by the caller owning download-and-placement before construction. Call `await model.load()` with no arguments.

### Type exports removed from `index.d.ts`

The following exports are no longer part of the package's public type surface because the loader/download layer they described is gone: `ReportProgressCallback`, `Loader`, `DownloadWeightsOptions`, `DownloadResult`. TypeScript consumers importing any of these must update to the new `LlmLlamacppArgs` / `files` shape.

## Features

### Constructor input validation

The constructor now throws `TypeError('files.model must be a non-empty array of absolute paths')` when `files` or `files.model` is missing or empty. This produces a clear error for callers porting old code instead of a confusing `Cannot read properties of undefined`.

### `run()`-before-`load()` guard

Calling `run()` before `load()` now throws `Error('Addon not initialized. Call load() first.')` instead of dereferencing `null` and crashing. `finetune()` already had this guard since the previous release.

### `load()` is now idempotent when already loaded

A second `load()` call on an already-loaded instance is now a silent no-op instead of unloading and reloading. This aligns with the ReadyResource pattern used elsewhere in QVAC and prevents accidental double-loads from triggering expensive work. Callers that intentionally want to swap weights must call `unload()` first (which clears `configLoaded`) and then `load()` again.

### Crash-safe shard streaming

If `_streamShards()` or `addon.activate()` throws mid-load (for example a corrupted shard file or a native init failure), the partially-initialized addon is now best-effort-unloaded and `this.addon` is reset to `null`. A subsequent `load()` call starts cleanly instead of leaking a zombie native instance.

### Restored JSDoc on `FinetuneOptions`

Every `FinetuneOptions` field carries a `/** … */` doc comment again, including the default values (`numberOfEpochs = 1`, `learningRate = 1e-4`, `batchSize = 128`, …) so IDE tooltips show them without needing to read `docs/finetuning.md`.

## Bug Fixes

### `unload()` clears the addon reference

`unload()` now sets `this.addon = null` after `await this.addon.unload()`, so post-unload `cancel()` / `pause()` / `run()` calls hit the explicit guards rather than dereferencing a disposed native handle. `pause()`, `cancel()`, and the job-handler cancel closure all use optional chaining for the same reason.

### Removed dead `_isSuppressedNoResponseLog` filter

The `_createFilteredLogger` infrastructure that wrapped the user-supplied logger to swallow `'No response found for job'` warnings was tied to the old `BaseInference` `_jobToResponse` Map. The new architecture cannot emit that message at all, so the filter, the wrapped logger, and the `_originalLogger` indirection are all removed. The user-supplied logger is now used directly.

### `load()` is serialized through the exclusive run queue

`load()` is now routed through the same `exclusiveRunQueue` used by `run()`, `finetune()`, and `unload()`. Previously two overlapping `load()` calls on the same instance could both pass the `configLoaded` guard before it flipped to `true`, both stream shards into and activate the native addon, and clobber `this.addon` — leaking one native handle. Concurrent `load()` on a single instance is now safe.

### Constructor rejects non-absolute path entries

Each entry in `files.model` is now validated with `path.isAbsolute()` (matching the existing error-message contract), and the same check now applies to the optional `files.projectionModel` — previously it had no validation at all. Relative paths are rejected at construction time instead of bubbling up from `bare-fs` or the native load.

## Pull Requests

- [#1494](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/1494) - chore[bc]: LLM addon interface refactor — remove BaseInference and WeightsProvider

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-09

### Breaking Changes

#### KV cache API simplified — `{ role: "session" }` replaced with `runOptions`

Cache control moved from `{ role: "session" }` chat messages to explicit `runOptions` fields: `cacheKey` and `saveCacheToDisk`. The `getTokens`, `save`, and `reset` session commands are removed — use `response.stats.CacheTokens`, `saveCacheToDisk: true`, and a different `cacheKey` (or omit it) instead.

### Added

- `cacheKey`, `saveCacheToDisk` options on `runOptions` and `RunOptions` TypeScript interface.
- `docs/cache-api.md` — KV cache API usage guide.

### Removed

- `{ role: "session" }` message protocol, `getTokens` command, `save` command.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- Updated qvac-fabric dependency from 7248.2.1 to 7248.2.3, which fixes OpenCL kernel cache support on Android.

### Added

- `openclCacheDir` option in `LlamaConfig` (`index.d.ts`): writable directory for OpenCL kernel binary cache, required on Android for fast GPU startup.
- `cache-type-k` and `cache-type-v` options in `LlamaConfig` (`index.d.ts`): configure KV cache quantization types.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-04-07

### Added

#### `backendDevice` runtime stat
- `runtimeStats()` now includes `backendDevice` (`"cpu"` or `"gpu"`) reporting the actual resolved device used for inference.
- Reflects the device after backend selection and fallback logic, not the user-configured preference.
- Captured as numeric `int64_t` (0/1) at the C++ level, mapped to a string in the JS layer.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-04-07

This patch release updates the qvac-fabric native dependency.

### Changed

#### qvac-fabric dependency bump

Updated qvac-fabric from 7248.2.1#1 to 7248.2.2, aligning all llamacpp-based addons on the same fabric version.

### Pull Requests

- [#1358](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/1358) - Qvac 16779 qvac fabric lockstep

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Updated inference-addon-cpp dependancy from 1.1.2 to 1.1.5
- Reason for the version update:
    - addon-cpp v1.1.2's cancelJob() unconditionally set the model's stop flag whenever a job existed, even if that job was only queued and never started processing. Since the queued job never entered process(), the flag was never consumed or reset.
    - In the llm addon, this meant that cancelling a request and then submitting a new one would cause the new request to abort instantly on entry — returning no results — because it inherited the stale stop flag from the previous cancel.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

#### `tools_at_end` configuration for dynamic tool management in multi-turn conversations

New `tools_at_end` configuration option (`"true"` or `"false"`, default: `"false"`) places tool definitions at the end of the prompt (after conversation history) instead of in the system prompt. This enables KV cache optimization for multi-turn conversations with dynamic tool sets, where tools change between turns. Currently supports Qwen3 models only.

- **KV cache trimming**: After each turn, tools are automatically removed from the KV cache, preventing stale tool definitions from accumulating
- **Conversation history reuse**: History tokens are preserved in cache, saving recomputation on long conversations
- **Dynamic tool replacement**: Different tool sets can be used per turn without cache bloat from unused tools

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

#### LoRA finetuning support

`model.finetune(options)` trains a LoRA adapter on top of a loaded GGUF base model. The adapter is saved as a `.gguf` file and can be loaded at inference time via the `lora` config option. Supports SFT (chat) and causal (next-token) training modes, configurable LoRA parameters (rank, alpha, target modules), validation (none / split / separate dataset), learning rate schedulers with warmup, pause/resume from checkpoints, and inference while paused. The returned `FinetuneHandle` emits `'stats'` progress events during training.

#### New public methods

- `model.finetune(options)` — starts LoRA finetuning, returns a `FinetuneHandle` with `on('stats', cb)` and `await()`.
- `model.pause()` — pauses finetuning and saves a checkpoint so training can resume later. Also cancels an in-flight inference job.
- Added typed `FinetuneOptions`, `FinetuneValidation`, `FinetuneProgressStats`, `FinetuneStats`, `FinetuneResult`, and `FinetuneHandle` interfaces to `index.d.ts`
- Added finetuning guide at `docs/finetuning.md`

### Changed

- `model.cancel()` now also clears pause checkpoints (`pause_checkpoint_step_*`) from the checkpoint directory, so the next `finetune()` call starts fresh instead of resuming.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-03-17

### Added

#### `contextSlides` runtime stat

`runtimeStats()` now includes a `contextSlides` counter that reports how many times the KV cache context window was slid during inference. This replaces the previous approach of parsing log messages to detect sliding context events, providing a reliable, structured stat for downstream consumers.

#### `RuntimeStats` TypeScript interface

Added a `RuntimeStats` type to `index.d.ts` covering all stats keys returned by the C++ addon: `TTFT`, `TPS`, `CacheTokens`, `generatedTokens`, `promptTokens`, and `contextSlides`.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-03-13

This release fixes antiprompt (reverse-prompt) detection for short stop sequences like `\n`, which is critical for translation workloads that rely on newline-based early stopping.

## Bug Fixes

### Antiprompt detection for short stop sequences

Fixed a bug where `checkAntiprompt()` in both `TextLlmContext` and `MtmdLlmContext` only searched the last few characters of the decoded output buffer for the antiprompt string. For short antiprompts like `"\n"` (length 1), the search window was limited to 3 characters at the tail. However, a single llama.cpp token can decode to many characters, placing `"\n"` far from the string's tail end — causing the antiprompt to be missed entirely.

The model would then run to `n_predict` (typically 256 tokens) instead of stopping after the first translated line, wasting compute and producing multi-line output that required post-processing to recover.

The fix widens the search to the entire `kNPrev`-token decoded window (32 tokens by default), reliably catching the antiprompt regardless of where it appears in the decoded string. This only affects models that use the `reverse-prompt` configuration — in practice, the AfriqueGemma translation workflow where `"\n"` signals end of translation.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

#### Per-request generation parameter overrides

`model.run(prompt, { generationParams: { temp: 0.7, predict: 256 } })` applies sampling parameter overrides for a single inference call without reloading the model. Load-time defaults are automatically restored after each request.

- Supported parameters: `temp`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `predict`, `seed`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `repeat_penalty`.
- `generationParams` is passed as a direct property on the addon input (same transport as `prefill`), parsed via N-API in `AddonJs.hpp`.
- C++ `applyGenerationParams()` returns a restore callable that captures saved state; exception-safe via try/catch in `processPrompt()`.
- Supported for both text and multimodal (`MtmdLlmContext`) models.
- Integration tests cover seed reproducibility, predict token limits, and defaults restoration.


## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

#### Hot-reload support (`LlamaModel::reload()`)

`LlamaModel` now stores its construction arguments (`modelPath`, `projectionPath`, `configFilemap`) and exposes a `reload()` method that rebuilds the model in-place from the stored args with `IMMEDIATE` loading (synchronous, blocking). This avoids tearing down and reconstructing the entire `LlamaModel` instance when the same model needs to be reloaded — for example, to reclaim GPU memory or recover from a corrupted context state.

All mutable model state (context, cache manager, backends handle, async weights loader, etc.) is grouped into an internal `ReloadableState` struct. On reload, the old state is replaced atomically with a freshly initialized one.

#### Thread-safe reload with `shared_mutex`

`LlamaModel` is now protected by a `std::shared_mutex` (`stateMtx_`):

- **Shared lock** for all read/use operations: `processPrompt`, `process`, `cancel`, `reset`, `runtimeStats`, `isLoaded`, `waitForLoadInitialization`, and `setWeightsForFile`.
- **Exclusive lock** only in `reload()` via `setInitLoader()`.

This means `reload()` blocks until all in-flight operations complete, while concurrent reads (e.g. multiple inference queries) can proceed in parallel. `cancel()` uses `std::try_to_lock` to gracefully skip cancellation if a reload is already in progress, since there would be nothing to cancel after the reload completes.

#### Streaming-loaded model reload guard

`reload()` now throws `ReloadNotSupportedForStreamedModel` (`StatusError`, error code 24) when called on a model that was loaded via streamed shards (`setWeightsForFile`). The streamed weight buffers are consumed (moved out) by llama.cpp during the initial load and cannot be replayed on reload.

### Changed

- Refactored `LlamaModel` internals: extracted `processPromptImpl` and `cancelImpl` (lock-free implementations) to separate locking concerns from business logic.
- `initializeBackend()` is now private — it is only called internally during `init()`.


## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added

#### Prefill mode for context preloading

`model.run(prompt, { prefill: true })` evaluates the prompt into the KV cache without generating tokens. This enables context preloading so that subsequent runs start with a warm cache.

- Prefill runs report `TTFT=0`, `TPS=0`, `generatedTokens=0`, `promptTokens=0`, while `CacheTokens` reflects actual KV cache occupancy.
- JS `normalizeRunOptions` validates `prefill` as a boolean; a `TypeError` is thrown otherwise.
- C++ `evalMessage`/`evalMessageWithTools` suppress logits on the last token when prefill is set; `processPrompt` returns immediately after evaluation.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-05

Preparation before fully supporting BitNet. Not officially supported yet, but this version already integrates logic necessary to support BitNet models.

### Added

#### Preparation: BitNet-aware backend selection for Adreno GPUs

Backend selection now detects BitNet models (TQ1_0 / TQ2_0 quantization via `hasOneBitQuantization()` and `general.architecture == "bitnet"`) and adjusts GPU routing on Adreno devices:

- **Adreno 800+** (e.g. Adreno 830): Vulkan is preferred over OpenCL, since BitNet TQ kernels are not supported on OpenCL.
- **Adreno < 800** (e.g. Adreno 740): Falls back to CPU, as TQ kernels run faster on CPU than on older Adreno GPU backends.
- **Non-Adreno GPUs**: No change — normal GPU selection applies.

This logic only activates when no explicit `main-gpu` is configured.

Adreno version detection works regardless of which backend exposes the GPU. The numeric generation (e.g. 830, 740) is parsed from the device description via `parseAdrenoVersion()` and tracked as `maxAdrenoVersion` during device enumeration for any Adreno device — whether it appears behind OpenCL, Vulkan, or another backend. This ensures the BitNet safety checks (CPU fallback on Adreno <800, Vulkan preference on Adreno 800+) are not bypassed when only Vulkan registers a device, as observed on Adreno 750.

#### Preparation: BitNet-aware config tuning (`tuneConfigMap`)

For BitNet models, `tuneConfigMap` injects default overrides into the config map before argument parsing:

- `flash-attn=off` — disables flash attention (unless the user explicitly set `flash-attn` or `flash_attn`).
- `ubatch-size=128` — on Adreno 800+ only (unless the user explicitly set `ubatch-size` or `ubatch_size`).

These entries are written to `configFilemap` (not to `common_params` directly), so they flow through the normal llama.cpp arg parser in `commonParamsParse`. The call sits after backend selection (where the Adreno version is known) but before the config map is converted to the arg vector.

#### `ModelMetaData::tryGetString()` method

`ModelMetaData` now exposes `tryGetString(key)` to retrieve string-typed GGUF metadata values. This is used by the BitNet backend selection logic to read `general.architecture`. Both `tryGetString()` and `hasOneBitQuantization()` are now virtual to support test mocking.

#### Unit tests for BitNet backend selection

Added comprehensive unit tests covering BitNet TQ backend selection across Adreno 830/740, non-Adreno GPUs, OpenCL-only scenarios, Vulkan-only scenarios, and mixed GPU/iGPU configurations. `MockModelMetaData` is defined in `test_common.hpp` and shared across test files.

### Changed

- Updated qvac-fabric-llm.cpp dependency from 7248.1.3 to 7248.1.4.
- Refactored `ModelMetaData` internal getters using a template helper, reducing duplication between `tryGetU32` and `tryGetString`.
- Added virtual destructor to `ModelMetaData` for correct polymorphic cleanup.
- Simplified `REQUIRE_MODEL` test macro by removing the `do {} while(false)` wrapper to suppress compiler warnings.


## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

#### Model metadata querying via LlamaModel

`LlamaModel` now exposes `ModelMetaData`, which parses GGUF key-values at init time (before weights are fully loaded) and makes them available for early decisions such as quantization detection and backend selection. Queries are available through `tryGetU32()`, `isU32OneOf()`, and `hasOneBitQuantization()`.

#### ModelMetaData streaming synchronization

For streaming model loads, `ModelMetaData` coordinates with `AsyncWeightsLoader` to borrow the first shard buffer. The synchronization state is encapsulated in a public nested class `ModelMetaData::FirstFileFromGgufStreamState` with `waitForRelease()` and `provide()` methods, protected by a mutex and condition variable. Both the consumer and producer waits are bounded by configurable timeouts.

### Fixed

#### GGUF streambuf reader fails to align data section (Fabric 1.1.3 upgrade)

Fixed a bug in the GGUF buffer reader (`gguf_bytes_buffer_reader::align`) where `pubseekoff` was called without specifying a direction (`std::ios_base::in`). The default `which` parameter is `ios_base::in | ios_base::out`, and per the C++ spec, `std::stringbuf::seekoff` with `way=cur` and both directions set always returns `-1` — regardless of the streambuf's open mode. This caused `"gguf_init_from_reader_impl: failed to align data section"` when loading model metadata from an in-memory stream (e.g. during streaming model loads), while the disk-backed `FILE*` path was unaffected because `fseek` has no direction concept.

The fix passes `std::ios_base::in` explicitly to `pubseekoff` in the llamacpp tether layer. This low-level alignment fix stems from the upgrade to Fabric 1.1.3.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Deterministic busy detection:** Replaced the timing-based `_lastJobResult` + 30ms timeout with a synchronous `_hasActiveResponse` boolean flag. On fast hardware (iPhone Metal GPU), short jobs could complete in under 30ms, causing the timeout-based race to be won by the resolved promise instead of the busy guard — allowing a second `run()` through. The flag is now checked synchronously inside `_withExclusiveRun` before any `await`, and cleared via a chained `response.await()` promise so ordering is structurally explicit.
- **Concurrency test made deterministic:** The `run | run` concurrency test now uses `Promise.race` to handle the case where the first job finishes before the second `run()` is rejected, preventing flaky failures on fast hardware.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-23
- Use patched version of addon-cpp to reduce logging noise.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-18

- Use new addon-cpp architecture for simplified Js Addon creation and usage.
- Use AddonCpp on CLI executable (to mimic JsAddon behavior/usage).
- Single job per addon instance; no templates, no state tracking.
- Asynchronous cancel based on futures: `await addon.cancel()` / `await response.cancel()` now wait until the job is actually finished.
- **Multiple images support:** Prompts can now include several `type: 'media'` user messages; each image is loaded in order and matched to placeholders so the model receives all images.
- Integration test for multiple images in one prompt (`llama addon can handle multiple images in one prompt`).

---

### Changed
- Multimodal parser now emits one user message per image (each with a single placeholder) so the tokenizer maps each placeholder to the corresponding bitmap and all images are in context.

### Breaking Changes

**LlamaInterface / Addon (native addon surface):**

- **Constructor:** The 4th argument `transitionCb` (state-change callback) was removed. The addon no longer reports LISTENING / IDLE / STOPPED etc.
- **Removed methods:** `pause()`, `stop()`, `status()`, **`destroyInstance()`** — single-job addon no longer exposes queue/state or pause/stop. Use **`unload()`** for teardown instead of `destroyInstance()`.
- **`append(data)` → `runJob(messages)`:** Input was a single object `{ type, input? }` (and a separate "end of job" append); now a **single array** of message objects for the whole run. No longer returns a job ID (only one job per instance).
- **`cancel(jobId?)` → `cancel()`:** No `jobId` argument (only one job). **Behavior:** `await addon.cancel()` (and thus `await response.cancel()`) now **waits until the job is actually finished** (future-based cancel in C++); previously `await` did not guarantee the job had stopped.

**LlmLlamacpp usage:**

- **Single job per run:** Each `run(prompt)` sends one `runJob(promptMessages)` and uses a fixed job id `'job'`. Queueing multiple `append()` calls and using multiple job IDs is no longer supported.
- **`END_OF_INPUT` / second append:** No longer used; the full prompt (including optional media) is sent in one `runJob()` call.

#### BEFORE

```typescript
// Old: constructor with state callback
const addon = new LlamaInterface(binding, config, outputCb, (state) => logger.info(state))

// Old: queue text then end-of-input; cancel by job ID
const jobId = await addon.append({ type: 'text', input: JSON.stringify(prompt) })
await addon.append({ type: 'end of job' })
// ...
await addon.cancel(jobId)  // jobId optional; await did NOT guarantee job finished

// Old: state and control
await addon.status()
await addon.pause()
await addon.stop()

// Old: teardown
await addon.destroyInstance()
```

#### AFTER

```typescript
// New: no state callback
const addon = new LlamaInterface(binding, config, outputCb)

// New: single run with array of messages; cancel with no args and proper completion
const promptMessages = [
  { type: 'media', content: mediaUint8Array },
  { type: 'text', input: JSON.stringify(textMessages) }
]
await addon.runJob(promptMessages)
// ...
await addon.cancel()  // no jobId; Promise resolves when job is actually finished

// status / pause / stop removed; use unload() for teardown
await addon.unload()
```

### API Changes

**Addon (LlamaInterface):**

- **`runJob(messages)`** — Runs one inference job. `messages` is an array of `{ type: 'media', content: Uint8Array }` and/or `{ type: 'text', input: string }` (e.g. JSON-stringified chat messages). No return value (no job ID).
- **`cancel()`** — Cancels the current job. No arguments. Returns a Promise that resolves when the job has finished (async cancel backed by futures in C++).
- **Constructor** — `(binding, configurationParams, outputCb)` only; `transitionCb` removed.
- **Removed:** `append`, `pause`, `stop`, `status`, `destroyInstance`. Use `unload()` for cleanup.

**Usage from LlmLlamacpp (unchanged for callers):**

- `model.run(prompt)` still returns a `QvacResponse`.
- `response.cancel()` still takes no arguments; the only change is that **`await response.cancel()`** now waits until the underlying job has actually stopped.

```typescript
// New API usage: single job per run, cancel waits for completion
await model.run(prompt)
// … optionally cancel and wait until job is really finished
await model.cancel()
```

## [0.8.9] - 2026-02-11

## Bug Fixes

### Large Embedding Output Crash Resolved

Fixed a `RangeError: Invalid string length` crash that occurred when processing large embedding datasets. The issue manifested when running inference on many sequences (e.g., 39,024 sequences from a 10MB text file with 256-character chunks and batch size of 512).

The root cause was in the base inference class, where debug logging attempted to `JSON.stringify` the entire embedding output data. JavaScript strings have a maximum length limit (~2^30-1 characters), which large embedding arrays can exceed.

This is fixed by updating the `@qvac/infer-base` dependency to v0.2.2, which removes the problematic debug logging while preserving all functional behavior. The `response.updateOutput(data)` call continues to work correctly—only the debug log that caused crashes was removed.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-02-01

## Bug Fixes

### System-Wide Library Conflicts Resolved

Fixed a critical issue where the addon could crash on systems with globally-installed llama.cpp libraries. The runtime's `dlopen()` calls were resolving `libggml-*.so` to system-wide installations (e.g., `/usr/lib/libggml-vulkan.so`) instead of the SDK's bundled backends, causing version mismatches and crashes like:

```
/usr/lib/libggml-base.so.0: GGML_ASSERT(prev != ggml_uncaught_exception) failed
```

This is fixed by updating the inference engine (qvac-fabric-llm.cpp 7248.1.0 → 7248.1.1) which introduces two changes:

1. **Namespaced backend libraries**: Backend libraries are now prefixed with `qvac-` (e.g., `libqvac-ggml-vulkan.so`), ensuring the runtime never accidentally loads incompatible system libraries.

2. **Eliminated unnecessary `dlopen()` calls**: On platforms using statically-linked backends (Linux, macOS, iOS, Windows), `dlopen()` is now skipped entirely, removing any risk of loading external libraries.

| Platform | Dynamic Backends | Behavior |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| Android | ON | Searches for `libqvac-ggml-*.so` (isolated from system) |
| Linux/macOS/iOS/Windows | OFF | No `dlopen()` - uses statically linked backends |

## [0.8.5] - 2026-02-01
This release fixes Android build support by ensuring Vulkan SDK is properly configured in the Android builder.

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this release.

## New APIs

There are no new public APIs in this release.

## Features

### Android Build Improvements

Android prebuild workflows now properly install and configure the Vulkan SDK on the builder. The Vulkan SDK is installed on the host, the same way as in Linux x64 builds. This change ensures that Android builds have access to the necessary Vulkan tools and libraries required for building the qvac-fabric dependency.

### Build Workflow Consistency

The build workflow conditions have been updated to use more consistent checks across Ubuntu-based builds. The Vulkan installation and configuration steps now use `startsWith(matrix.os, 'ubuntu-')` conditions instead of platform-specific checks, making the workflow more maintainable and consistent.

## Bug Fixes

There are no user-facing bug fixes in this release.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-01
This release improves compatibility for Linux ARM64 users by building prebuilt binaries on Ubuntu 22.04 instead of Ubuntu 24.04. This results in binaries linked against an older glibc version, enabling the addon to run on a wider range of Linux ARM64 systems.

## Improved Linux ARM64 Compatibility

Linux ARM64 prebuilt binaries are now built on Ubuntu 22.04 runners instead of Ubuntu 24.04. This change produces binaries with lower glibc requirements, making them compatible with more Linux distributions and older system versions. Users on Linux ARM64 systems that previously encountered glibc version errors should now be able to use the prebuilt binaries without issues.

## Internal Changes

- Added Ubuntu 22.04 ARM to the integration test matrix for broader CI coverage
- Removed obsolete cross-compilation tooling

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-01
This release improves addon compatibility by switching Linux x64 builds to Ubuntu 22.04. The change add support for the current oldest Ubuntu LTS version (Ubuntu-22.04), while maintaining support for Ubuntu-24.04.

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this release.

## New APIs

There are no new public APIs in this release.

## Features

### Build System Improvements

Linux x64 prebuilds are now built on Ubuntu 22.04 instead of Ubuntu 24.04, providing compatibility with the current oldest Ubuntu LTS release. The build workflow has been updated to install g++-13 on Ubuntu 22.04, providing support for modern C++ features while linking against the Ubuntu-22 glibc version. Integration tests now run on both Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 to ensure compatibility across both versions.

### Workflow Simplification

The CI/CD workflows have been simplified with more generic condition checks that work across all Ubuntu versions. This makes the workflows easier to maintain and reduces the need for version-specific conditionals. The ccache configuration has also been simplified for better reliability.

## Bug Fixes

There are no user-facing bug fixes in this release.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-01
This release focuses on improving distribution quality for prebuilt artifacts without changing the public API surface. Prebuilds are now leaner, which reduces download size and speeds up installation for supported platforms.

## Breaking Changes
There are no breaking changes in this release.

## New APIs
There are no new public APIs in this release.

## Features
The prebuild workflow now removes debug symbols by applying platform-specific stripping tools, using the Android NDK’s `llvm-strip` on Android, `strip -S` on Apple platforms, and `strip --strip-debug` on Linux, which reduces package size and improves download times while keeping runtime behavior unchanged.

## Bug Fixes
There are no user-facing bug fixes in this release.
