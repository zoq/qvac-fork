  // QVAC-17830: iOS Device Farm (iPhone 16 Pro / 17) was hanging the
  // on-PR run on this image because the 3000x4000 (~12 MP) JPEG pushed
  // peak memory past the ~3.3 GB Jetsam ceiling once the device was
  // already warm from earlier jobs in the queue. The app died via
  // memorystatus and Appium never got a clean failure signal, so the
  // Device Farm run sat in RUNNING (PENDING) until the 60-min job
  // timeout. Mirror the fruit-plate mitigation: pre-warm the multimodal
  // pipeline with the tiny elephant.jpg (~23 KB) so Metal shaders,
  // KV cache, and image-prefill buffers are allocated *before* the
  // 12 MP JPEG arrives, and cap iOS counted iterations at 1 regardless
  // of QVAC_PERF_RUNS. Together this keeps the iOS cold-path footprint
  // at exactly 2 inferences (1 small pre-warmup + 1 counted real image)
  // — the same shape fruit-plate uses, which reliably passes.
