 * Per-request lifecycle handle. Created by `RequestRegistry.begin(...)`

 *
 *  - `requestId` — stable identity; visible to the client so it can
 *    target this exact request with `cancel({ requestId })`.
 *  - `signal` — `AbortSignal` that fires when the request is cancelled.
 *    Composes with addon-level cancellation through a single
 *    `signal.addEventListener("abort", ...)` hook installed by the
 *    handler.
 *  - `scope` — `DisposableScope` for `await using` / `Symbol.asyncDispose`
 *    cleanup. The scope unwinds whether the handler returns, throws, or
 *    is cancelled — there is no manual cleanup path for handlers to
 *    forget on the cancel branch.
 *  - `state` — current lifecycle state. Treat as read-mostly; the
 *    registry mutates it.
