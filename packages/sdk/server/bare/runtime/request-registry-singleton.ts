 * Exposed alongside `createRequestRegistry()` rather than replacing it so
 * unit tests can spin up isolated registries without contaminating the
 * shared instance. On first use the singleton registers the SDK's
 * baseline concurrency policies.

// therefore can't actually execute at once on the same model. Sharing one
// admission lane makes the SDK queue reflect that reality: a completion and a
// batch on the same model serialize FIFO at the SDK layer instead of both being
// admitted and silently serializing inside the addon (which hides them from the
