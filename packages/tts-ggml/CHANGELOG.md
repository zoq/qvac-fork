# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-03

### Changed
- Optimize OpenCL GPU backend implementation (Android) for Parler-TTS model
- Update `ggml-speech` dependency version to align with other packages that also depend on it.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **Parler no longer fails on iOS with `parler: DAC decode failed`.** The DAC
  decoder's compute arena grew with the output length (~13.6 + 1.957 MiB per
  frame, unbounded), and streaming re-decoded the whole code prefix on every
  chunk, so a streamed utterance walked ~10 growing allocations up to 837 MiB.
  That is fatal on iOS, where Metal buffers are backed by `posix_memalign`, and
  invisible on macOS, which uses `vm_allocate`. Decoding is now windowed, so
  peak DAC memory is constant in output length and streaming is 2.2–2.5×
  faster. Audio is unchanged.

### Changed

- **Parler always samples.** `topK: 1` selects argmax decoding, which this model
  family cannot terminate — it collapses into a silence attractor after the
  first word, and end-of-sequence is gated on the first codebook emitting EOS as
  its argmax, so generation runs to `maxFrames` and yields a truncated utterance
  followed by silence. Such requests are now repaired to the model's sampled
  defaults (temperature 1.0, `topK` 50) with a warning on stderr. Use `seed` for
  reproducible output — a fixed seed is bit-reproducible.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Parler-TTS engine (mini-v1 / large-v1 / indic) (QVAC-19261).** Third
  engine family under the same `TTSGgml` surface: description-conditioned
  TTS (Flan-T5 encoder → delay-pattern decoder → DAC codec, native
  44.1 kHz). Detection via `engine: 'parler'`,
  `files.parlerModel`, or a `modelDir` containing
  `parler-<mini|large|indic>[-vN][-<quant>].gguf` (mini > large > indic;
  q8_0 > q6_k > f16 > f32 within a variant). The indic variant covers 21
  Indic languages with script-native digit normalization.
- **Parler Metal GPU support (QVAC-21593).** `config.useGPU: true` /
  `nGpuLayers` offloads the Parler engine to Metal on Apple (~2.25x vs CPU
  on indic q8_0; decode flash-attention + fused QKV/heads + DAC phase-matmul);
  other backends fall back to CPU and the CPU output stays byte-identical.
  Adds CPU + Metal CI coverage across the published quant tiers.
- **Parler voice descriptions + emotion flag.** The voice is set either by
  a free-text `description` (alias `voiceDescription`) or by template
  fields — `voice`, `emotion`, `pitch`, `pace`, `expressivity`, `noise`,
  `reverb`, `quality` — rendered natively by tts-cpp's
  `build_description()` in the models' training-caption phrasing.
  `emotion` accepts the 12 trained styles (command, anger, narration,
  conversation, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, proper noun, news, sad,
  surprise; case-insensitive, invalid values error listing the set).
  Description and template fields are mutually exclusive at the same
  level; everything defaults to the models' recommended fallback caption,
  so Parler works with zero description configuration. Template fields
  are also accepted **per call** (`run({ input, emotion })`,
  `runStream`/`runStreaming` options) — the only engine with a per-call
  channel — merging over the constructor fields without a reload.
- **Parler sampling/generation knobs.** `temperature`, `topK`, `topP`,
  `maxFrames`, `minNewTokens`, `normalizeNumbers`, `seed`, `threads`,
  `config.outputSampleRate` (addon-side resample from the native
  44.1 kHz), all optional with the GGUF's generation defaults. Requires a
  `tts-cpp` pin that ships the parler engine (qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp
  PR #92). New `examples/parler-tts.js`, integration/unit suites, C++
  config tests, and a `parler` model-download group (mini q8_0).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Migrated the published JavaScript wrapper to generated TypeScript sources and added declarations for the supported `./text-chunker` and `./lib/textStreamAccumulator.js` subpath exports, while preserving the existing CommonJS runtime API.
- Desktop linux-arm64 prebuilds now ship per-arch ggml CPU variants (`tts-cpp` >= 2026-07-13#2, pulling `ggml-speech` 2026-07-14): the previous armv8-a-baseline build compiled out the ARM dotprod/fp16 kernels (chatterbox q4 CPU mean RTF 2.70 -> 2.28 on ubuntu-24.04-arm).
- Bumped the `tts-cpp` `version>=` floor from `2026-07-13#2` to `2026-07-13#3` (registry PR [tetherto/qvac-registry-vcpkg#253](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-registry-vcpkg/pull/253)), which raises the `ggml-speech` floor to `2026-07-15` (`tetherto/qvac-ext-ggml` speech `d7e27ac7`, [#42](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-ext-ggml/pull/42) — QVAC-21623 ggml-opencl Adreno FLASH_ATTN partial-KV NaN fix + q8_0 SOA `get_rows` + faster f16 GEMV/GEMM). `tts-cpp` source is unchanged (rebuild-only re-pin); the delta is OpenCL-only (non-Adreno / Vulkan / Metal / CPU byte-identical). Registry baseline unchanged.

### Added

- **Chatterbox S3Gen classifier-free-guidance rate (`cfgRate`) (QVAC-21908).**
  New optional `cfgRate` knob for the Chatterbox engine, surfacing the S3Gen
  CFG rate that was previously fixed to the model's GGUF-baked value. The S3Gen
  CFM diffusion loop normally runs a batched cond+uncond pass combined by this
  rate; passing `cfgRate: 0` makes it run **cond-only** (skips the uncond pass,
  roughly halving S3Gen compute at some quality cost), and a positive value
  overrides the model rate. Omit it to keep the model's baked rate (full
  backward compat); negative values are rejected at construction. Plumbed
  through `ChatterboxConfig::cfgRate` → `JSAdapter` → `EngineOptions::s3gen_cfg_rate`
  and exposed on the JS surface (`index.d.ts` `TTSGgmlOptions.cfgRate`), with
  C++ validation/mapping unit tests and a JS param-forwarding test. Requires the
  `tts-cpp` pin bump to `2026-07-13#1` (qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp PR #88), which
  adds `EngineOptions::s3gen_cfg_rate` / `s3gen_synthesize_opts::cfg_rate`.
- **LavaSR enhancer GPU acceleration.** The 48 kHz bandwidth-extension enhancer
  now runs on the GPU when the model is constructed with the GPU enabled (the
  same `useGPU` / `nGpuLayers` config the engine uses) — Vulkan on Windows/Linux,
  Metal on macOS/iOS — and falls back to the CPU otherwise.
- **Enhancer backend surfaced in `runtimeStats()`.** Both the Chatterbox and
  Supertonic models now report `enhancerBackendDevice` (`-1` none / `0` CPU /
  `1` GPU) and `enhancerBackendId` (the ggml backend id, e.g. `3` for Vulkan),
  so hosts can confirm where the enhancer actually ran.
- **LavaSR enhancer + denoiser wiring in the shipped `test/utils` helpers.**
  `runChatterboxTTS` / `runSupertonicTTS` accept optional `lavasrEnhancerPath`
  and `lavasrDenoiserPath` that map to the addon's `files.lavasrEnhancer` (the
  LavaSR 48 kHz bandwidth-extension enhancer) and `files.lavasrDenoiser` (the
  UL-UNAS speech denoiser, which runs before the enhancer) — each path is the
  "on" switch for its stage, so an unset value leaves that stage off.
  `downloadModel.js` gains `ensureLavaSREnhancerGguf()` / `ensureLavaSRDenoiserGguf()`
  — which fetch their GGUF from the QVAC registry by default, with
  `LAVASR_ENHANCER_GGUF` / `LAVASR_DENOISER_GGUF` /
  `LAVASR_{ENHANCER,DENOISER}_REGISTRY_PATH` / locally-staged overrides — plus
  shared `normalizeEnhancer()` / `normalizeDenoiser()` helpers. The benchmark/CI
  enhancer and denoiser axes built on these utilities are documented in
  `benchmarks/RTF-BENCHMARKS.md`.
- **LavaSR enhancer quant tier in the shipped `test/utils` helpers.**
  `downloadModel.js` `ensureLavaSREnhancerGguf({ quant })` now resolves a per-tier
  enhancer GGUF — `f16` (default) / `f32` / `q8_0` — to its own on-disk file
  (`lavasr-enhancer.gguf` for the byte-stable `f16` default,
  `lavasr-enhancer-<tier>.gguf` otherwise) and registry path, with shared
  `normalizeEnhancerVariant()` / `enhancerVariantTag()` helpers. A published tier
  (`isEnhancerVariantPublished()` — `f16`/`f32` today) that fails to resolve is a
  real error the benchmark hard-fails on, matching the engine GGUF, while a
  not-yet-published tier soft-skips; the shared policy lives in
  `classifyEnhancerResolution()` / `classifyDenoiserResolution()`. The benchmark/CI
  enhancer quant axis built on these utilities is documented in
  `benchmarks/RTF-BENCHMARKS.md`.
- **LavaSR enhancer / denoiser on the mobile Device Farm benchmark.** The
  `integration-mobile-test-tts-ggml.yml` benchmark matrix now sweeps the fp16
  enhancer (CPU + GPU) and the denoiser (CPU) on supertonic + chatterbox for both
  Android and iOS. iOS resolves the GGUFs from the registry on-device; Android has
  no on-device network, so `scripts/generate-mobile-model-manifest.js` pre-signs
  the fp16 enhancer + denoiser and `scripts/generate-prestage-block.js` adb-pushes
  them into `<models>/lavasr/`, where `ensureLavaSREnhancerGguf` /
  `ensureLavaSRDenoiserGguf` (now scanning the Android prestage dirs) pick them up.
  The label and perf-report artifact name gain the `lavasr` / `denoise` tags so the
  new rows don't collide with the engine-only rows. CI-only; not shipped with the
  npm package.
- Opt-in `vulkanCacheDir` (Supertonic + `useGPU: true`): persists the Vulkan pipeline cache (`GGML_VK_PIPELINE_CACHE_DIR`) and pre-warms it at `load()` so the first-dispatch shader-compile cost is paid once per install, not on the first `run()`. Fully opt-in/non-breaking; Vulkan analogue of `openclCacheDir` (QVAC-21910, tetherto/qvac#3120).
- **Per-call cancellation via `AbortSignal` on `run()`.** `model.run({ input, signal })` now accepts an optional `AbortSignal`; when it aborts, `response.await()` rejects with the abort reason. An already-aborted signal rejects deterministically without dispatching the engine (no native interrupt) — the race-free way to cancel on fast hardware. Additive/non-breaking. Non-streaming `run()` only: **ignored when `streamOutput: true`** (and on `runStream` / `runStreaming`). (QVAC-22247, tetherto/qvac#3260)

### Changed

- Internal refactor to apply the team coding standards; no public API or behavior change.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.4` (JsLogger concurrent-env ownership hardening fix, QVAC-21544 follow-up).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.3` (JsLogger teardown / re-`setLogger` crash fix, QVAC-21544, tetherto/qvac#2932).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Chatterbox no longer crashes at load on Samsung S25 / Adreno GPU.** The
  multilingual model's quantized weights were uploaded to the OpenCL backend in
  partial pieces, which the backend read past and faulted on at model load.
  Quantized weights are now uploaded whole. Bumps the `tts-cpp` requirement to
  `2026-07-06`.
- **T3 (Chatterbox Turbo/MTL) now falls back to CPU per-op instead of aborting
  when the GPU backend can't run an op.** New shared `sched_dispatch` helper
  (mirroring the existing S3Gen/Supertonic pattern) walks the graph and only
  engages a `ggml_backend_sched` fallback when the primary backend can't run
  every op, so the happy-path direct-compute output is unchanged. S3Gen and
  Supertonic converge onto the same helper, which also fixes a Supertonic
  sched graph-reuse corruption bug on natural-sched backends (Adreno). Bumps
  the `tts-cpp` requirement to `2026-07-07`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.2` (self-pin fix for safe `Worklet.terminate()` on Android).

### Added

- **Chatterbox MTL Chinese (`zh`) synthesis.** `config.language: 'zh'` is now
  accepted for the multilingual Chatterbox model. Chinese flows through the
  Cangjie (hanzi → code) tokenizer path, so it requires a `Cangjie5_TC` TSV
  supplied via `files.cangjieTsvPath` — when it is missing, `tts-cpp` throws a
  clear error at load instead of silently degrading. Bumps the `tts-cpp`
  requirement to `2026-07-03#0`, the registry port that adds `zh` to
  `mtl_tokenizer::supported_languages()` (qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp PR #77).
  The multilingual integration suite replaces its previous `zh` rejection
  assertion with a real Chinese synthesis test (mirroring the Japanese/MeCab
  test), and `downloadModel.js` gains `ensureCangjieTsv()` to stage/convert the
  Cangjie5_TC table. The s3gen model downloads now pull the published q4_0
  GGUFs (`chatterbox-s3gen-q4_0.gguf` / `chatterbox-s3gen-mtl-q4_0.gguf`)
  instead of f16.

- **LavaSR neural speech enhancement.** Opt-in CPU/GGML post-processing that
  bandwidth-extends synthesized audio to **48 kHz** using the LavaSR Vocos
  enhancer (ConvNeXt backbone + ISTFT spec head), converted to a single GGUF.
  Enhancement is enabled simply by supplying the enhancer GGUF — there is no
  separate on/off flag:

  ```js
  new TTSGgml({
    engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_SUPERTONIC,
    files: { supertonicModel, lavasrEnhancer: 'lavasr-enhancer.gguf' }
  })
  ```

  The path may instead be given via an `enhancer: { type: 'lavasr', enhancerPath }`
  block; an unknown `enhancer.type` is rejected so a typo can't silently disable
  enhancement. When active, `TTSOutputChunk.sampleRate` is `48000` for both
  engines. Convert the GGUF from the public LavaSRcpp ONNX release with
  `scripts/convert-lavasr-enhancer-to-gguf.py` (f32 or f16). Examples:
  `examples/supertonic-enhanced.js`, `examples/chatterbox-enhanced.js`.
  Requires the `tts-cpp` pin that ships `tts_cpp::lavasr::Enhancer`
  (qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp PR #68). The denoiser stage is wired below.

- **LavaSR denoiser wiring.** The addon now exposes the second LavaSR
  stage — the UL-UNAS speech **denoiser**, which cleans the signal *before* the
  enhancer bandwidth-extends it — via `files.lavasrDenoiser` (or a
  `denoiser: { type: 'lavasr', denoiserPath }` block), mirroring the enhancer:

  ```js
  new TTSGgml({
    engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_SUPERTONIC,
    files: {
      supertonicModel,
      lavasrDenoiser: 'lavasr-denoiser.gguf', // cleaned first…
      lavasrEnhancer: 'lavasr-enhancer.gguf'  // …then bandwidth-extended
    }
  })
  ```

  The denoiser is rate-preserving and runs before the enhancer on the batch
  path (both engines). The tts-cpp UL-UNAS forward is implemented in
  qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp PR #78 (`tts_cpp::lavasr::Denoiser`, scalar CPU port
  validated bit-close to the ONNX reference). With no denoiser path, output is
  byte-identical (full backward compat). Denoiser + Chatterbox native chunk
  streaming (`streamChunkTokens`) is rejected up front — a stateful streaming
  denoiser is the follow-up. Active as of the `tts-cpp` pin bump to
  `2026-07-03#1` (qvac-registry-vcpkg), which ships the PR #78 UL-UNAS forward.

- **Selectable output sample rate.** `outputSampleRate` (8000–192000 Hz,
  runtime config) now resamples the synthesized audio to the requested rate,
  and `TTSOutputChunk.sampleRate` reports it. Without the enhancer the tts-cpp
  engine resamples (batch once / streaming per-chunk, seam-free;
  `EngineOptions::output_sample_rate`, qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp PR #69); with
  the enhancer active the 48 kHz enhanced signal is resampled to the requested
  rate afterwards. Omit it to keep the engine's native rate (default, zero
  behaviour change).

- **Enhancer + Chatterbox native chunk streaming.** The LavaSR enhancer now
  works with `streamChunkTokens > 0` (previously rejected). The addon runs the
  enhancer over a sliding window with look-ahead + crossfade, so each streamed
  chunk is bandwidth-extended seam-free and tagged 48 kHz (or `outputSampleRate`)
  — matching the batch result. It adds **~0.34 s of look-ahead latency**,
  inherent to the enhancer's receptive field.

### Notes

- Enhancement works on the batch path, sentence-level streaming, and Chatterbox
  native chunk streaming. Native-streaming enhancement adds ~0.34 s of
  look-ahead latency.
- When the enhancer is active it produces 48 kHz; if `outputSampleRate` is also
  set, the enhanced audio is resampled to that rate afterwards.


### Fixed

- **Chatterbox MTL Japanese now builds with MeCab support from the published
  registry ports.** Bumps the `tts-cpp` requirement to `2026-06-30`, links
  `mecab::mecab` directly, and keeps the Windows `/FORCE:MULTIPLE` workaround
  for the `mecab.lib` / `bare_delay_load.lib` `DllMain` conflict.
- **Chatterbox MTL language coverage now includes Japanese and Italian in the
  shared multilingual suite.** The standalone Japanese test has been folded into
  `chatterbox-mtl.test.js`. (Chinese `zh` synthesis is now enabled — see the
  Added section above.)
- **Chatterbox now synthesizes correctly on both ARM CPU and the ARM Mali Vulkan
  GPU.** Bumps the `tts-cpp` pin to `2026-06-26` (`qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp`
  master `586268bf`, PR #67), consumed from `qvac-registry-vcpkg` (#214), which
  in turn requires `ggml-speech 2026-06-26` (`qvac-ext-ggml` speech `f5727c32`,
  PR #30); the `default-registry` baseline advances to `162f8f7c` so the new pins
  resolve.
  - **GPU (ARM Mali / Vulkan — Google Tensor / Pixel):** the CFM estimator's f32
    `ggml_flash_attn_ext` miscomputed on Mali, blowing the f0 predictor up to NaN
    and collapsing the audio into a clean ~1.3 s followed by a buzzy "blank +
    beeps" break. Chatterbox now runs on Mali via an `is_arm_mali`-gated unfused
    CFM attention (`soft_max` + separate-V matmul, numerically equivalent and
    still on the GPU). Zero change off ARM Mali; CPU output byte-identical.
  - **CPU (ARM SVE — Google Tensor / Pixel):** the SVE leftover-tail of
    `ggml_vec_dot_f32` dropped the main loop's partial sums on inactive lanes
    (`svmad_f32_m` → `svmla_f32_m`), biasing the HiFT `conv_transpose_1d` inner
    dot and producing a constant ~12 kHz Nyquist tone. NEON/x86/RISC-V and all
    non-CPU backends are byte-identical.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Chatterbox Metal GPU crash on the multilingual model — default KV-cache
  dtype changed from `q8_0` to `f16`.** With the `q8_0` KV cache (the default
  since 0.3.2, QVAC-19557), running the **multilingual** Chatterbox model on a
  **Metal GPU** hard-aborted mid-synthesis with
  `GGML_ABORT("unsupported op 'CONT'")`. The multilingual step graph
  (`eval_step_mtl`, B=2 cond+uncond batched path) issues a `CONT` on the KV
  cache, and the ggml-speech Metal backend only implements a `q8_0`-source
  `CONT` to `f32`/`f16` — not `q8_0`→`q8_0` — so the op fails
  `ggml_metal_device_supports_op` and aborts. The EN **Turbo** model and the
  **CPU** backend were unaffected (different graph / backend supports the op),
  which is why ≤0.2.5 worked on GPU and 0.3.2+ regressed. `f16` (~50% of f32,
  vs `q8_0`'s ~27%) is now the safe cross-backend default; `q8_0` remains
  available opt-in via `kvCacheType: 'q8_0'` for memory-constrained CPU/CUDA
  hosts that implement the op. A proper backend-aware fix (extend
  `chatterbox_resolve_kv_type` to probe `CONT` support, not just flash-attn)
  belongs in `qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp` and would let Metal keep `q8_0` storage.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Bump the `tts-cpp` pin to `2026-06-24`** (`qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp` master
  `46921668`, PR #65), consumed from `qvac-registry-vcpkg`. Brings QVAC-19557
  **S3TokenizerV2 host-mirror elimination**: the Chatterbox voice-conditioning
  bake no longer holds the ~458 MB S3Tokenizer encoder weights in a host
  `std::vector` mirror *and* the backend (Metal) weight buffer simultaneously —
  `build_encoder_ctx` now streams each encoder tensor straight from the GGUF
  into its backend tensor (8 MiB chunks, no host mirror). This drops the
  ~900 MB dual-residency that dominated the Chatterbox first-`synthesize()`
  peak; on-device (iPhone 17 Pro Max) the first-test peak falls from ~3184 MB to
  ~2772 MB (under the ~3 GB iOS jetsam budget), warm synthesis unchanged, and
  the produced audio is bit-identical (same tensor names/shapes/dtypes). The
  `default-registry` baseline advances to `1130cabb` so the new pin resolves.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Chatterbox speaking-rate control (`speed`) (QVAC-21119).** New optional
  `speed` config for the Chatterbox engine — a duration multiplier mirroring
  Supertonic's `speed` (`< 1` slower, `> 1` faster), bounded to `[0.25, 4.0]`.
  Chatterbox's engine exposes no native rate knob (its S3 speech tokens run at
  a fixed 25 Hz and the utterance duration is emergent from the autoregressive
  T3), so the addon applies it as a pitch-preserving WSOLA time-stretch on the
  24 kHz PCM — functionally equivalent to ffmpeg's `atempo`, not a pitch shift.
  Opt-in and backward compatible: when unset (or `1.0`) the raw model output is
  left unchanged — no default slowdown. Works in both batch and native
  streaming (one stretcher threads the overlap-add state across chunks for
  seam-free output, with `O(chunk + window)` memory). Plumbed through
  `ChatterboxConfig::speed`, `JSAdapter`, and `_buildChatterboxParams`
  (mirroring Supertonic). New `examples/chatterbox-adjust-speed.js` (+
  `example:chatterbox-adjust-speed` npm script), C++ WSOLA unit tests, and a JS
  integration test.

### Fixed

- **Chunk-streaming saturation/clipping and per-chunk loudness "wobble" on the
  Chatterbox Multilingual engine (QVAC-21118).** A low `cfmSteps` /
  `streamCfmSteps` (1–2) under-integrated the model's standard 10-step CFM in
  the chunk-streaming path, producing near-full-scale output (~99%, RMS 4–9×
  hotter than batch) with a collapsing tail. The engine now floors the
  streaming CFM step count to the model's `n_timesteps` for standard-CFM
  models; Turbo's meanflow 2-step sampler and the batch step count are
  unaffected. Consumes `tts-cpp` `2026-06-22` (`qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp`
  PR #62).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Windows prebuilds now link the static Visual C++ runtime (`/MT`) instead of
  importing `vcruntime140.dll`, `msvcp140.dll`, or UCRT DLLs from the MSVC
  redistributable. Shared monorepo `vcpkg-overlays/triplets/{x64,arm64}-windows.cmake`
  build dependencies with a static CRT; addon CMake no longer links `msvcrt.lib`,
  which had forced the dynamic runtime. Per-package vcpkg overlays were
  consolidated into the shared `vcpkg-overlays/` tree. No public API change.

## Pull Requests

- [#2722](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/2722) - QVAC-21100: Switch to static C/C++ windows runtimes

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Android GPU for Supertonic + Chatterbox (QVAC-20557).** Remove the `#ifdef __ANDROID__`
  guards in `SupertonicModel`/`ChatterboxModel` that forced `useGPU=false`; `useGPU` now flows
  to `tts-cpp` (bumped to registry `2026-06-18` = `b95ad447`), which picks the GPU backend per
  its per-vendor allowlist — Supertonic on Adreno (OpenCL) / Xclipse + Mali (Vulkan); Chatterbox
  on Adreno/Xclipse, with Mali declined by policy (`allow_arm_mali=false`) and surfaced via the
  new `gpuUnsupported` runtime stat. The `default-registry` baseline advances to `6fe4e2b` so the
  new version resolves. Android gpu-smoke skips dropped (Supertonic strict; Chatterbox accepts a
  flagged Mali→CPU fallback).

### Fixed

- **QVAC-19557: Chatterbox iOS peak-memory OOM — cap the T3 context at
  4096 and store the KV cache as q8_0 by default.** tts-cpp allocates
  the T3 KV cache up-front at the GGUF's full `n_ctx`; the Turbo GGUF
  ships `n_ctx=8196`, which costs ~1.6 GB of f32 KV
  (`n_embd(1024) × n_layer(24) × 8196 × 4 B × 2`) and pushed the iOS
  QVAC SDK test process to a ~3.1 GB peak footprint (jetsam kill — the
  `tts-chatterbox-*` e2e variants are currently skipped on iOS Device
  Farm for exactly this).  The addon now passes
  `EngineOptions::n_ctx = 4096` and `kv_cache_type = "q8_0"` (~210 MB
  of KV for ≈160 s of generated audio per `synthesize()` call) unless
  the host overrides them via the new `nCtx` / `kvCacheType`
  constructor options.  `nCtx: 0` restores the uncapped context;
  `kvCacheType: "f32"` restores the bit-exact pre-quantisation
  behaviour; negative `nCtx` and unknown `kvCacheType` values are
  rejected at construction.  Upstream validation
  (qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp#43): Turbo greedy token sequences are
  byte-identical across f32/f16/q8_0 on CPU and Metal, and Metal
  decode is 20-30% faster from the KV bandwidth saving.

### Changed

- **`tts-cpp` pinned to `2026-06-19`** (`qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp` PR #43 on
  top of master `b95ad447`) for `EngineOptions::kv_cache_type` and the streamed
  (no host-staging) chatterbox GGUF loads. The Android `GGML_BACKEND_DL` symbol
  routing (`ggml_backend_is_cpu` / `ggml_get_type_traits_cpu` → backend registry
  shim + `ggml_quantize_chunk`) now comes from the `b95ad447` base via QVAC-20557
  (PR #54), so this package no longer carries that fix itself.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **End-of-speech robustness for the Chatterbox multilingual engine
  (QVAC-20616).** Fixes the model emitting up to ~20s of random tokens after
  the intended text finishes. Consumes the new `tts-cpp` stop logic: an
  alignment-based EOS analyzer (ports the reference `AlignmentStreamAnalyzer`
  cross-attention signal, extracted from the GGML graph via an in-graph
  attention probe) layered with a heuristic stop controller (EOS confidence,
  n-gram repetition, text-length budget) and per-language calibration. An
  anti-early-truncation `suppress_eos` path keeps very short inputs from being
  clipped. Validated end-to-end on desktop (CPU + Vulkan/RTX) and on real
  mobile GPUs (Android OpenCL + iOS Metal via AWS Device Farm), plus a
  round-trip ASR regression gate (synthesize → Whisper transcribe → compare).

### Added

- Internal RTF + streaming benchmark suite for the Chatterbox and Supertonic GGML engines (`test/benchmark/rtf-benchmark.test.js`, `test/benchmark/streaming-benchmark.test.js`, matrix runner, `scripts/perf-report/aggregate-tts-ggml-rtf.js`), runnable via the `Benchmark RTF (TTS GGML)` GitHub Actions workflow on the `qvac-*-gpu` self-hosted runners (CPU + Vulkan). CI-only; not shipped with the npm package.
- Mobile (Android / iOS) RTF + streaming benchmark leg for the `Benchmark RTF (TTS GGML)` workflow via AWS Device Farm, opt-in through the `include_mobile` dispatch input. CI-only; not shipped with the npm package.
- RTF benchmark reports now surface the desktop GPU hardware name (QVAC-20499). `test/benchmark/rtf-benchmark.test.js` drives the shared performance reporter's `detectDevice()` (via `bare-subprocess`: nvidia-smi / vulkaninfo / system_profiler) to populate `device.gpu` / `device.cpu` in the canonical report and `labels.gpuModel` in the per-config JSON; `scripts/perf-report/aggregate-tts-ggml-rtf.js` renders a `GPU Model` column. Mobile leaves `device.gpu` null (device name is the proxy). CI-only.

### Changed

- Bump the `tts-cpp` pin to `2026-06-18` (`qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp` master
  `b95ad447`), consumed straight from `qvac-registry-vcpkg`. Carries QVAC-20616
  (the EOS fix above, PR #53) and QVAC-20557 Supertonic Android GPU (PR #54:
  Adreno OpenCL + Xclipse/Mali Vulkan). The latter reroutes the direct
  Supertonic CPU-backend calls (`ggml_backend_is_cpu` /
  `ggml_get_type_traits_cpu`) to ggml-base + a registry shim — the upstream
  successor to the interim `f7d4d6c` overlay that 0.3.0 carried — so the addon
  `dlopen`s cleanly on Android with no package-local overlay port.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Supertonic 3 (31-language) support (QVAC-19305).** Brings the v3 Supertonic
  model to the addon: `index.js` recognises the Supertonic 3 GGUFs in the
  `modelDir` auto-detect / path-resolve paths (the v3 GGUFs are published per
  quant tier with the quant in the filename, e.g. `supertonic3-f16.gguf` /
  `supertonic3-q8_0.gguf`, so the lookup matches any `supertonic3[-<quant>].gguf`).
  The v3 model/inference code lands in `tts-cpp` (`qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp` PR
  #42, `master` @ `24eeb028`); `vcpkg.json` bumps the `tts-cpp` pin to
  `2026-06-12`.
- **Supertonic 3 GGUF tooling.** `convert-supertonic2-to-gguf.py --arch
  supertonic3` (text-encoder ConvNeXt dilations + vector-estimator CFG
  numerical-parity fixes; pipeline parity < 2e-4 across en/ko/es/pt/fr) and
  `requantize-gguf.py` q8_0 / q4_0 block-quant support (ConvNeXt pointwise convs
  squeezed to 2-D and re-expanded at load via `supertonic.pwconv_squeezed`,
  fixing the old q4_0 SIGBUS). These are the converters used to produce the
  GGUFs published to the registry.
- **Registry-hosted Supertonic 3 models.** All four tiers are published on the
  QVAC model registry (f16 / f32 @ `2026-06-10`, QVAC-20568; q8_0 / q4_0 @
  `2026-06-15`, QVAC-20686). `download-tts-ggml-models.js` +
  `test/utils/downloadModel.js` fetch every tier from S3 (per-tier build dates).
- **Supertonic 3 integration tests** (`test/integration/supertonic3-quant.test.js`):
  sweep f16 / f32 / q8_0 / q4_0 across the five inherited (en/ko/es/pt/fr) plus
  the new v3-only (de/it/nl) languages; assert load + run + 44.1 kHz output. A
  tier that can't be fetched fails the run (every tier is published on the
  registry). Mobile integration auto-test wiring added.
- **Supertonic GPU support (re-land of QVAC-19255, reverted in 0.2.2).**
  Caller GPU intent (`useGPU` / `nGpuLayers`) is honored again for the
  Supertonic engine on GPU-capable hosts (Metal on Apple, Vulkan/CUDA on
  desktop), matching Chatterbox. The `SupertonicModel::validateConfig` /
  `index.js` "CPU only today" rejection is removed; the cross-field conflict
  check (`useGPU=true` + `nGpuLayers=0`, or vice versa) is preserved.

### Changed

- Resolve `tts-cpp` entirely from the official `tetherto/qvac-registry-vcpkg`
  registry: drop the package-local `ports/tts-cpp` overlay (and the
  `overlay-ports` entry in `vcpkg-configuration.json`) used during development
  as an interim measure, and bump the `default-registry` baseline to `e55f10fb`
  (`tts-cpp` `2026-06-12`, `ggml-speech` `2026-06-15`). The baseline preserves
  the `ggml-speech` Metal residency-set teardown fix that the overlay previously
  pinned (#2645).
- Bumped the `@qvac/infer-base` runtime dependency from `^0.4.0` to `^0.6.0` ([#2636](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac/pull/2636)).

### Notes

- **Android stays CPU-only for Supertonic.** The `#ifdef __ANDROID__`
  force-off in `SupertonicModel::loadLocked` is kept, so `useGPU=true` on
  Android transparently falls back to CPU: Adreno Vulkan/OpenCL `ggml` graph
  compute still aborts (same family as the parakeet Adreno crash). The GPU
  smoke test skips Supertonic on Android accordingly.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Android: revert the `tts-cpp` `2026-06-05` bump (introduced in 0.2.1)
  that crashed the addon at `dlopen` during bootstrap, taking down every
  Android e2e run.** `tts-cpp` `2026-06-05` pins upstream
  `qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp@128dae42` (the QVAC-19254 "sched + cpu_backend
  refactor"), which added direct `ggml_backend_is_cpu` /
  `ggml_get_type_traits_cpu` calls inside the statically-linked `tts-cpp`
  library. On Android the shared `ggml-speech` port builds the CPU backend
  as runtime-`dlopen`'d per-microarch MODULE `.so` variants
  (`GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON` + `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON`; no static CPU
  archive), so those two symbols are left `UND` in
  `libqvac__tts-ggml.*.so`'s dynamic symbol table with no `DT_NEEDED` able
  to resolve them — the CPU variant libraries are only `dlopen`'d lazily
  inside Engine construction, long after Bare loads the addon. Bare's
  resolver therefore fails to register the addon
  (`ADDON_NOT_FOUND: linked:libqvac__tts-ggml.*.so` / `dlopen failed`) and
  the unhandled rejection aborts the process (SIGABRT) ~1 s into
  bootstrap. iOS and desktop (Linux/macOS/Windows) statically link the CPU
  backend and were never affected. Pin `tts-cpp` back to `2026-06-03#1`
  (the last-known-good revision, the one 0.2.0 shipped) so the Android
  addon loads cleanly again.

### Reverted

- Reverts the 0.2.1 Supertonic GPU enablement (QVAC-19255, #2473) in full:
  the `tts-cpp` pin, the `SupertonicModel.cpp` / `index.js` `useGPU` /
  `nGpuLayers` gate removals, the flipped C++ unit tests and
  `gpu-smoke.test.js` integration test, and the README / `index.d.ts` /
  examples docs. With `tts-cpp` back at `2026-06-03#1` Supertonic is
  CPU-only again, so the rejection gates and the CPU-only contract are
  restored to keep the package internally consistent. The Supertonic GPU
  work should re-land once the Android CPU-backend linkage is fixed
  upstream (QVAC-19254 follow-up against `tts-cpp` / `ggml-speech`, e.g.
  by statically linking `ggml-cpu` into the addon on Android the way
  desktop/iOS already do).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-05 — superseded by 0.2.2

> **Broken on Android.** The `tts-cpp` `2026-06-05` dependency this release
> introduced crashes the addon at load time (`dlopen` failure → SIGABRT)
> on Android ARM64; iOS and desktop are unaffected. Reverted in 0.2.2 (see
> above). The entry below describes what 0.2.1 attempted and is retained
> for history.

### Added

- **Supertonic now supports GPU execution.** Consumes `tts-cpp`
  `2026-06-05`, which brings the QVAC-18605 Supertonic Vulkan/Metal
  optimisations (rounds 1-13, ~34× realtime on Apple M-series Metal)
  and the QVAC-19254 sched + cpu_backend refactor for Adreno OpenCL.
  Caller intent (`useGPU` / `nGpuLayers`) is now honoured for Supertonic
  the same way it is for Chatterbox; backend selection follows
  tts-cpp's `init_gpu_backend` tier policy (Adreno 700+ → OpenCL,
  otherwise Vulkan/Metal/CUDA via the registry walk, otherwise CPU).

### Changed

- Removed the validateConfig hard-throw on `useGPU=true` /
  `nGpuLayers != 0` for Supertonic in both `SupertonicModel.cpp` and
  `index.js`. The conflicting-pair check (`useGPU=true` + `nGpuLayers=0`
  or vice versa) is preserved.
- Removed the Android force-off block in `SupertonicModel::loadLocked`.
  Android GPU selection is delegated to tts-cpp's `init_gpu_backend`
  tier policy (Qualcomm Adreno allowlist; Mali / non-Adreno skipped).
- Flipped the C++ unit tests that previously expected GPU rejection
  (`test_supertonic_config.cpp::UseGpuTrueRejectedWithExplanation`,
  `NGpuLayersGreaterThanZeroRejected`) into acceptance tests; added a
  new test asserting the cross-field conflict check is still enforced.
- Flipped the Supertonic entry in `test/integration/gpu-smoke.test.js`
  from "rejected at constructor" to "must engage GPU backend on
  GPU-capable platforms", mirroring the Chatterbox smoke contract.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Bumped the `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to `1.2.1`.

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed

- Consume `tts-cpp` `2026-05-20#2`, which keeps BLAS enabled only on
  macOS and disables host BLAS/OpenBLAS auto-linking everywhere else.

## [0.1.3]

### Fixed

- Consume `tts-cpp` `2026-05-20#1`, which disables host BLAS/OpenBLAS
  auto-linking for Linux prebuilds.

## [0.1.2]

### Changed

- **`useGPU` now defaults to `false` for Chatterbox** (was `true` in 0.1.1
  and earlier). Opt in with `config: { useGPU: true }` on GPU-capable
  hosts. The auto-enable was flipped because Android dynamic-backend
  builds OOM on small-RAM devices (e.g. 8 GB Galaxy S23 FE) when the
  Vulkan / OpenCL backend mirrors ~1 GB of f16 `chatterbox-s3gen.gguf`
  into GPU memory on top of the mmap'd CPU copy, tripping the Android
  low-memory killer (`lmkd` SIGKILL). Hosts on capable GPUs (Apple
  Silicon, CUDA desktops, Adreno 700+ phones with enough free RAM)
  should pass `config: { useGPU: true }` explicitly. Supertonic stays
  CPU-only.
- **Android dynamic backend selection** (consumed via tts-cpp
  2026-05-20): the addon now ships `prebuilds/android-arm64/qvac__tts-ggml/`
  with per-arch `libqvac-speech-ggml-cpu-android_armv*_*.so` files plus
  `libqvac-speech-ggml-{vulkan,opencl}.so`, picked up at runtime via
  the new `BACKENDS_SUBDIR` join + the registry walk in
  `tts_cpp::detail::init_gpu_backend()` (Adreno 700+ → OpenCL, every
  other GPU → Vulkan/Metal/CUDA). New `backendsDir` + `openclCacheDir`
  options on the JS surface let hosts point at a non-default prebuilds
  root or persist the OpenCL program-binary cache.

### Fixed

- Metal allocation failure on iOS leading to crash after package was
  unloaded and loaded several times.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed two issues when loading chatterbox on iOS:
  - gguf_init_from_file race: bake_voice_conditioning() now runs before s3gen_preload_thread is spawned, so the two gguf_init_from_file calls no longer race against ggml's process-global state (previously aborted in ggml_abort on iOS).
  - Metal shared-buffer-type init race when unload is called immediately after load

## [0.1.0]

Initial release of `@qvac/tts-ggml`, a GGML-backed TTS addon wrapping the
`tts-cpp` library. Exposes both `tts_cpp::chatterbox::Engine` and
`tts_cpp::supertonic::Engine` behind a single engine-agnostic JS surface,
intended as a substitute for `@qvac/tts-onnx`.

### Added

- **Chatterbox engine** (English + multilingual via `chatterbox-t3-mtl.gguf` /
  `chatterbox-s3gen-mtl.gguf`). 24 kHz native output. Supports voice cloning
  from a reference wav and baked voice-conditioning tensors via `voiceDir` /
  `voicesDir`.
- **Supertonic engine** (single-file `supertonic.gguf`). 44.1 kHz native
  output. Voice selection via `voice` / `voiceName` (e.g. `'F1'`, `'M1'`).
- **Engine auto-detection** from `files` (chatterbox-\* gguf vs supertonic.gguf),
  with explicit override through the `engine: 'chatterbox' | 'supertonic'`
  option. Static constants `TTSGgml.ENGINE_CHATTERBOX` / `ENGINE_SUPERTONIC`
  and `getEngineType()` method.
- **GPU backend cascade** at load time. Chatterbox routes through Metal /
  CUDA / Vulkan / OpenCL when available; pass `nGpuLayers: 99` to fully
  offload. `useGPU` defaults `true` for Chatterbox. `RuntimeStats` now
  reports the active backend via `backendDevice` (0 = CPU, 1 = GPU) and
  `backendId` (0 = CPU, 1 = Metal, 2 = CUDA, 3 = Vulkan, 4 = OpenCL,
  99 = other-GPU).
- **Streaming APIs** aligned with `@qvac/tts-onnx`:
  - `run({ streamOutput: true, ... })` — sentence-chunked synthesis with
    `onUpdate` PCM emission.
  - `runStream(text, options?)` — convenience wrapper over `run`.
  - `runStreaming(textStream, options?)` — `string | string[] | Iterable |
    AsyncIterable` text input, PCM out per flushed job.
- **Chatterbox-only native streaming knobs:** `streamChunkTokens` (speech
  tokens per native chunk; 25 ≈ 1 s of audio, `0` disables),
  `streamFirstChunkTokens` (smaller first chunk for low TTFB), `cfmSteps`
  (CFM Euler step count; `1` halves cost, `2` matches Python meanflow).
- **Supertonic-only knobs:** `steps` (vector-estimator CFM steps; `0` =
  GGUF default), `speed` (speech-rate factor), `noiseNpyPath` (optional
  `.npy` initial-noise tensor for byte-exact reference reproduction).
- **Cross-compat aliases with `@qvac/tts-onnx`:** `voiceName` (alias of
  `voice`) and `numInferenceSteps` (alias of `steps`) accepted on options
  so call sites migrating from tts-onnx need fewer changes.
- **Output sample-rate control:** `runtimeConfig.outputSampleRate` and
  per-job `TTSRunInput.outputSampleRate` (8000–192000 Hz) resample the
  engine's native rate before emission. `TTSOutputChunk.sampleRate` is
  reported on every chunk.
- **Pre-chunked streaming metadata:** `SentenceStreamChunkMeta.isLast`
  flag on the final chunk of `runStream` / `run({ streamOutput: true })`.
- **Tuning knobs:** `seed` (RNG for CFM initial noise + SineGen
  excitation / Supertonic latent), `threads` (overrides
  `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`), `nGpuLayers`.
- **File-path inputs:** `TTSGgmlFiles` accepts `modelDir` plus per-component
  GGUF paths (`t3Model`, `s3genModel`, `supertonicModel`) with `*Path`
  long-form and short aliases (`t3`, `s3gen`, `supertonic`).
- **C++ unit tests** (GoogleTest) and `coverage:cpp` target (llvm-cov).
- **Mobile integration test** generator (`test:mobile:generate` /
  `test:mobile:validate`).

### Differences vs `@qvac/tts-onnx`

Call sites migrating from `@qvac/tts-onnx` should be aware of the
following — these are not bugs, just intentional surface differences:

- **No LavaSR enhancer.** `EnhancerConfig` / `LavaSREnhancerConfig`, the
  constructor `enhancer` option, and the per-job `TTSRunInput.enhancer`
  override do not exist in `@qvac/tts-ggml`. There is no neural
  bandwidth-extension or denoiser path in the GGML backend today.
- **`referenceAudio` is a path string**, not `Float32Array | number[]`.
  Pass the absolute wav path; the native layer reads it.
- **`numThreads` → `threads`.** The ONNX-style `numThreads` is not
  accepted; use `threads` instead.
- **`supertonicMultilingual` is removed.** Multilingual mode is driven by
  the loaded GGUF (`chatterbox-*-mtl.gguf`) and engine selection rather
  than a runtime boolean.
- **GPU semantics differ for Supertonic.** `useGPU: true` and any non-zero
  `nGpuLayers` are **rejected at construction time** on Supertonic — the
  engine is CPU-only today. (Chatterbox accepts both and defaults
  `useGPU` to `true`.)
- **ONNX-style `*Path` file aliases are not accepted.** The GGML backend
  is single-GGUF-per-component, so the file set is much smaller; only the
  ggml-native field names listed under `TTSGgmlFiles` are honored.
